Until last year, there were three horse abattoirs in the United States --two in Texas and one in Illinois. But they closed after both states, under pressure from animal rights groups, passed laws banning killing horses for human consumption. The Illinois slaughterhouse, run by Cavel International, an affiliate of a Belgian company, had employed about 60 people and killed  between 40,000 and 60,000 horses each year, with annual revenues of 20 million dollars. Cavel had fought the ban, arguing that since almost all of its meat was exported to Europe and Japan, the Illinois law encroached on federal regulations on international commerce. But an appeals court rejected Cavel's argument in September, saying the company had failed to show that stopping its operations risked affecting the global horse meat market. On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case any further appeal. Cavel's appeal had received backing from Belgium, which told the court, \"American horse meat is considered by consumers in Belgium and elsewhere in the EU to be of the highest quality and distinguishable from horse meat produced from other nations.\" Sapa-AFP \/np","label":0}

Three people were arrested on Thursday when police found more than 300 firearms, ammunition, and explosives at a house in Norwood, north of Johannesburg. A Ukrainian couple and their domestic helper were arrested on allegations of  renting out the weapons to hardened criminals for cash-in-transit heists and ATM bombings.  Police found R1 rifles, R4 rifles, R5 rifles, AK-47 rifles and about 300 handguns. Detonators, a machine used to manufacture ammunition, packaged dagga,  and explosives used for ATM bombings. The three, Emma Shumler-Tishko, 62, her husband Mark, 59, and Endi Nkhoma, 26, appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Monday. The case was postponed to next week Tuesday for a bail application. They face four charges -- possession of unlicensed firearms, possession of ammunition, dealing in dagga, and contravention of the Explosives Act.

The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading eurozone shares advanced 0.18 percent to 3,320.44. The euro stood at 1.2191 dollars. On Wall Street, the major indices were mixed as profit-taking hit shares of Procter and Gamble following strong results, but a stronger-than-expected US manufacturing report and an upgrade for eBay offered some support. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 18.9 points to 10,622.0, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was 7.83 points higher at 2,192.66. In London, bank stocks were boosted by better-than-expected interim results from HSBC, the world's second-biggest bank by market capitalization. HSBC posted a 5.0 percent increase in first-half pretax profit to 10.640 billion dollars, ahead of the forecast range of 9.2 billion to 10.4 billion. Shares in HSBC rose 0.81 percent to 930.50 pence, helping rally the sector.

Deutsche Boerse, the Frankfurt exchange operator, was the best performer on the DAX, reaching all-time highs, up 3.06 percent at 74.66 euros amid news that it is to name a new chief executive in September. The stock also was helped by a thumbs up from Morgan Stanley, which hiked its price target to 75 euros from 65 and raised its earnings per share estimates for the operator. \"We continue to rate Deutsche Boerse 'overweight' as we believe it offers value in an international context and we see restructuring optionality,\" Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.

The 24-year-old Mzolo made a brief appearance at the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday morning. He is accused of killing 21-year-old Khumalo, a first-year quantity surveying student, inside her Lonsdale residence room on 1 May, and then, through a series of obscure social media posts, is believed to have confessed. The court heard that 20 witnesses would be called throughout the duration of the trial. The state has alleged that Khumalo ended the relationship she had with Mzolo in March or April this year. According to the indictment: \"The termination of the relationship was not accepted by the accused. He decided to kill her.\" Spurned by his former partner, Mzolo allegedly made his way to the off-campus residence, situated near the city centre, and gained entry after sending another student to check that Khumalo was in her room. Mzolo is alleged to have gunned down Khumalo in front of her roommate and the student who checked if she was in her room. \"The accused confronted the deceased, reprimanded her for making a fool of him. He drew the firearm from his bag and fired shots at the deceased, fatally wounding her,\" according to the indictment. The gun used in the killing was a nine-millimetre calibre that had its serial number removed. Mzolo also, according to the indictment, had in his possession three live rounds of ammunition. At his first appearance, Mzolo garnered the wrath of students and community members for consistently grinning for photographers and appearing to make a trigger sign when leaving the courtroom, which was captured by journalists. Speaking to African News Agency (ANA) on Wednesday, Mzolo's attorney, Charl Claassen, said that he was still negotiating with the State on behalf of his client. \"His charge is premeditated murder but we want to negotiate for murder,\" he said.

On Monday, Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin said the Russian delegation would not participate in the upcoming winter PACE session nor would it present its PACE credentials. The following day, PACE head Anne Brasseur announced that the Russian delegation would not be able to participate in any kind of PACE work in 2016 as it had not presented all the necessary documents. \"This year's non-participation in PACE work...does not mean the cessation of our contacts with the Council of Europe,\" Alexei Pushkov told reporters.

The government's Energy Information Agency said that booming production from  shale and other \"tight oil\" formations will push the country's daily production  to 7.92 million barrels a day from 6.43 million barrels a day in 2012. Production last year already gained 780,000 barrels a day from 2011 thanks to surging production from fracking operations tapping shale resources in the North Dakota region, the EIA said in the report released Tuesday. The continuing rise will by 2014 push US production to its highest level since 1988, closing in on the world's leading producer Saudi Arabia, which puts  out more than 10 million barrels a day, most of it exported. The rise in production will be paralleled however by a fall in global oil prices, the EIA said: the price for the benchmark Brent crude, which averaged $112 a barrel last year, will drop to $105 on average this year and $99 in 2014. The falling price is driven due to higher supplies on the market of both oil  and gas, thanks to growing exploitation of previously inaccessible oil shale and other tight oil and gas formations. The rise in the past few years of fracking -- which involves using high pressure to collapse complex rock formations, along with horizontal drilling, to release the hydrocarbons -- has been at the root of the production surge.

This continued a trend that began in 2013, as mine deaths had previously been over a hundred a year. Of the 84 deaths, 44 occurred in gold mines, 15 in platinum mines, nine in coal mines, and 16 in other mines. Other mines include diamond, chrome, copper, and iron ore mines. A total of 93 miners died in 2013; 37 at gold mines, 27 at platinum mines, seven at coal mines and 22 on other mines. The industry had made steady progress in reducing fatalities. The 2014 figure was an 86 percent drop from the 615 deaths recorded in 1993. Despite the improvement, the minister said he was concerned about the seven mineworkers who had already been killed in 2015. \"I want to convey my serious concern that we continue to experience loss of life in the sector. It is with deepest regret and sadness that so early in 2015, seven mine workers have already lost their lives.\" He said it was apparent from the figures that gold and platinum mines were the main contributors to accidents and fatalities. \"This is regrettable, as we believe that these mines should be at the forefront in terms of the appropriate systems and expertise to enhance health and safety.\" Workers' health and safety was crucial to mining's long-term sustainability,  the minister said. \"Hence our steely resolve to implement enforcement measures in terms of the law.\" The deaths were grouped into \"general classification\" fatalities (35 percent), falls-of-ground (30 percent), and transportation-related deaths (17 percent). General classification includes inhaling dangerous fumes, being struck by an  object, and falling from height. The number of mine injuries dropped by about 18 percent, from 3123 in 2013, to 2569 in 2014. \"Although this is the lowest ever reported, the department is still greatly concerned about the high number of injuries reported at our mines,\" Ramatlhodi said. This was because most of the reported injuries were not new, but mainly due to repeat accidents.

{"id":"5db56b78ee1f2000174634e2","url":"SAPAI-73ce8e50a0-17814.txt","text":"INVENTORY REPORT By GILLIAN WONG Oil prices fell Wednesday in Asia from a trading record above US{dollar}88 a barrel hit overnight, amid expectations a U.S. fuel report due later in the day would show U.S. crude and gasoline stocks rose last week. Prices remained supported by concerns a Turkish incursion into Iraq in search of Kurdish rebels could disrupt crude supplies. Turkey's parliament is expected Wednesday to agree that the government can launch a cross-border attack into Iraq sometime over the  next year. The government has said an offensive against the rebels in northern Iraq will not immediately follow the authorization. An incursion would threaten the pipeline that runs from Kirkuk, in Iraq, to the Turkish export terminal of Ceyhan. While exports of crude from Kirkuk to Ceyhan have been sporadic since the U.S.-led invasion of  Iraq in 2003, oil has been flowing the past two months and in recent days was being shipped at a rate of nearly 500,000 barrels a day, Dow Jones Newswires reported. Light, sweet crude for November delivery dropped 10 cents to US{dollar}87.51 a barrel in Asian electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange by midday in Singapore. The contract rose US{dollar}1.48 to close at a record US{dollar}87.61 a barrel Tuesday in the U.S. after rising  as high as US{dollar}88.20, a trading record. Oil prices have also been driven higher by recent reports from the U.S. Energy Department, the International Energy Agency and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries suggesting oil supplies are flat or falling as demand is growing. Despite the gains, the price of oil is still below inflation-adjusted highs hit in early 1980. Depending on the adjustment, a US{dollar}38 barrel of oil in 1980 would be worth US{dollar}96 to US{dollar}101 or more today. Many analysts argue that the supply and demand fundamentals don't support oil in the high US{dollar}80 range, and believe speculative investing is the real culprit behind high oil prices. And as long as investors are willing to keep buying, prices will keep rising. Traders were turning their attention to the U.S. Energy Department's  midweek petroleum supply snapshot to be released later Wednesday. Crude  oil and gasoline stockpiles were expected to have increased 1 million barrels each for the week ended Oct. 12, according to the mean forecast  in a Dow Jones Newswires survey of analysts. Distillates, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, were expected to have fallen 400,000 barrels. Refinery use was expected to have grown by 0.4 percentage point of capacity. Heating oil futures lost 0.53 cent to US{dollar}2.3334 a gallon (3.8 liters) while gasoline prices fell 0.05 cent to US{dollar}2.1732 a gallon. Natural gas futures declined 0.2 cent to US{dollar}7.365 per 1,000 cubic feet.   Sapa-AP","label":0}

{"id":"5db56b78ee1f2000174634c9","url":"SAPAI-542ce4df0a-83740.txt","text":"Speculation that a major stock market merger would soon be unveiled surged Thursday with the pan-European operator Euronext saying its plans were progressing quickly and would be revealed next week. Euronext has already identified Deutsche Boerse, the operator of  the Frankfurt stock exchange, as a potential partner, but several newspapers have also linked the group with the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE, the world's biggest equity market, traces its roots to  a gathering of 24 brokers under a tree on Wall Street in 1792. Since that seed was planted, the NYSE has grown into a giant oak  with the market value of its listed companies worth more than 21 trillion dollars -- more than the Nasdaq, Tokyo, London, Euronext and Frankfurt exchanges combined. That includes seven trillion dollars worth of non-US shares. The NYSE has survived and prospered despite scandal, war and the  periodic outbreak of mass panic. Wall Street's most well-known institution in March underwent a change to become a publicly traded company under the ticker \"NYX,\" and as a result of a merger with the Archipelago Exchange, began to  implement electronic trading. Unlike its US and European peers, the world's biggest bourse had  stuck with \"open outcry\" trading -- shouted instructions from brokers dressed in rainbow jackets to clerks who all jostle for space on a heaving, paper-strewn floor. Some 2,800 companies and investment funds are quoted on the NYSE's Big Board, including 28 of the 30 members of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrials. Notably absent from the NYSE are the two other Dow components Microsoft and Intel, traded on the rival Nasdaq. The Bank of New York is the only company whose shares have been continuously traded since 1792. The addition of an element of computerized trading -- which supporters say is faster, more efficient and more profitable -- came after the NYSE completed a 9.5-billion-dollar merger with Archipelago. The new NYSE also diversified into corporate bonds and complex stock products like derivatives and equity options, instead of just  trading shares. Back in the 19th century, the first big technological innovation  was the introduction of ticker tape to show the latest share prices  in 1867. Telephones came to the NYSE in 1878 and electric lights in  1883. Up to March, the NYSE was controlled by its members, including the 1,366 who own \"seats\" and enjoy full trading rights. The value of an NYSE seat has exploded in recent years, topping four million dollars at the end of 2005. Last year also saw the volume of shares traded on the NYSE surpass three billion for the first time. But the exchange has yet to go back up to the giddy heights of the \"dotcom\" boom, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average of its 30 leading companies hit a record high of 11,722.98 in January 2000. The collapse of the dotcom mania pales in comparison to the events of October 1929, when prices on the NYSE crashed to trigger a series of financial disasters that culminated in the Great Depression. The NYSE has endured periodic closures of trading, including after the September 11 attacks of 2001, and confidence-sapping scandals involving financial skullduggery and insider trading. The NYSE came under new leadership in 2003, when its chief executive Richard Grasso was forced out after it was revealed that the NYSE had awarded him a package worth nearly 140 million dollars. Its current chief executive is John Thain. Sapa-AFP","label":1}

Hours after seeing fellow title rivals Tottenham and Arsenal draw 2-2 in the north London derby, Leicester beat Watford 1-0 away to extend its lead to five points with just nine games remaining. While Real Madrid is still far behind Spanish leader Barcelona, Ronaldo hit another scoring landmark with four second-half goals to fuel a 7-1 rout of Celta Vigo. His 252 career goals according to the league are only second to Barcelona star Lionel Messi's 305. Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain, the respective leaders in Germany and France, were both held to scoreless draws. Here is a look at Europe's major leagues: ___ ENGLAND Riyad Mahrez grabbed Leicester's winner at Watford with his 15th goal of the season, controlling the ball at the edge of the area and curling an exquisite shot into the top corner in the 56th minute. A team that was almost relegated last season is showing no sign of slowing up in its charge to the title. The same cannot be said of the other contenders. Alexis Sanchez equalized to earn 10-man Arsenal a point against Spurs, meaning both sides dropped two points on Leicester. Leicester has 60 points, Tottenham 55 and Arsenal 52. Fourth-place Manchester City beat Aston Villa 4-0 to end a run of three straight losses. Sergio Aguero scored two of the four second-half goals. West Ham scored three goals in the final 12 minutes to rally to a 3-2 win at Everton and keep in touch with the top four, which could now be out of reach for Chelsea after the soon-to-be-deposed champions drew 1-1 at home to Stoke. Newcastle lost 3-1 to Bournemouth and Norwich fell 1-0 at Swansea as both losers stayed in the relegation zone, and Southampton scored in the last minute to draw 1-1 against Sunderland. SPAIN Ronaldo's four goals took him past Telmo Zarra's mark of 251 that had stood as a record until Messi broke it in 2014. Besides surpassing Zarra's mark for Athletic Bilbao from 1955, Ronaldo also passed Barcelona's Luis Suarez as the league top scorer for the season. Ronaldo has 27 goals to Suarez's 25. After Pepe put Madrid ahead before halftime, Ronaldo scored with a long blast. He added another goal from a free kick, tapped in a short cross, and headed home a corner kick. Jese Rodriguez and Gareth Bale completed the demolition of a Celta side that held its own before halftime but fell apart in the second half. Madrid remained in third place and a provisional nine points behind Barcelona, which visits Eibar on Sunday, when second-place Atletico Madrid also visits Valencia. Elsewhere, Las Palmas ended fourth-place Villarreal's 14-round unbeaten streak with a 1-0 away win, Sevilla drew 1-1 at Getafe, and an own goal gave Malaga a 3-3 draw at Deportivo La Coruna. GERMANY Bayern took another small step toward an unprecedented fourth successive Bundesliga title with a hard-fought scoreless draw at closest rival Borussia Dortmund. Bayern, which had a healthy eight-point lead before Wednesday's shock home defeat to Mainz, preserved the five-point gap with nine games remaining. Also, Claudio Pizarro scored his 100th Bundesliga goal for Werder Bremen in a 4-1 win over last-place Hannover and Bayer Leverkusen came from three goals down to draw 3-3 at Augsburg. Schalke won 3-1 at Cologne to move to fourth. Wolfsburg defeated Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-1, Stuttgart routed Hoffenheim 5-1, and Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 with Ingolstadt. FRANCE Paris Saint-Germain prepared for its Champions League game against Chelsea with an unimpressive 0-0 draw against Montpellier. PSG coach Laurent Blanc rotated his team at the Parc des Princes to avoid any injuries ahead of Wednesday's match at Stamford Bridge. PSG's Edinson Cavani hit the crossbar in the third minute, and Montpellier goalkeeper Laurent Pionnier denied Zlatan Ibrahimovic in stoppage time. PSG remained 23 points ahead of second-place Monaco in the standings. Nice beat Troyes 2-1 and rose to third place, while sixth-place Saint-Etienne missed drew 0-0 at Angers. Lille defeated Reims 2-0, Bordeaux drew with Ajaccio 1-1, and Lorient drew 0-0 at Bastia. ITALY Napoli came from behind to beat Chievo Verona 3-1 and move provisionally level with Juventus at the top of the Serie A table. Nicola Rigoni gave Chievo a surprise lead in the second minute but Gonzalo Higuain leveled four minutes later. Vlad Chiriches and Jose Callejon secured its first win in six matches in all competitions. Juventus visits Atalanta on Sunday. Sampdoria also beat bottom club Hellas Verona 3-0.","label":0}

CMCS chairman Janet Welham said the Medicines Act of 1965 published in July incorporated complementary medicines into the same category as orthodox medication -- shutting down access to these medicines by 80 percent. Welham said the regulations were \"unfair\" because complementary medicines would be controlled by the Pharmacy Act. This, she said, meant a pharmacist had to be present during the manufacturing, distribution and advertising of their products. \"Currently the Adverse Drug Reaction Committee within the Medicines Control Council only has a qualified group for the pharmaceutical paradigm. We want a complementary medicines committee within the MCC to oversee our medicines\". She said the committee was unhappy because a clause within the regulations stated complementary medicines could not be advertised.  This did not allow the public to make informed decisions when purchasing medicine. The CMSC is demanding from the Department of Health separate and  appropriate regulations for complementary medicines. It is also demanding there be an appropriate marketing code, in the form of advertising, which will allow the public to make informed decisions when purchasing products.

The profit for the 12 months to June 30 was in line with its guidance, the operator of the nation's main international gateway said,  as investors remained focussed on a takeover bid from Dubai Aerospace Enterprises. The airport company noted its result was at the top end of its NZ{dollar}91-92 million (US{dollar}64-65 million; ?47-48 million) guidance issued in July. Profit was hurt by a NZ{dollar}9.9 million (US{dollar}7 million; ?5.2 million) provision for its long-term incentive schemes for senior management and  staff due to a significant rise in the company's share price. Modest growth in passengers and higher interest costs associated with stepped-up capital expenditure also restrained earnings during the  year. Auckland Airport remains positive about its outlook, predicting operating profit and revenue growth of 7 percent in fiscal 2008. Earnings growth at the airport has slowed over the past two years on  softening passenger volumes, and due to high capital expenditure linked  to an expansion of key services. But analysts note the company's strong position in New Zealand will generate solid long-term returns. The NZ{dollar}2.6 billion (US1.8 {dollar}million; ?1.4 million) takeover bid made in July by the Dubai company, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, underscored the airport's attractiveness, they said. The deal needs approval from 75 percent of shareholders - which include Manukau City Council, 10.05 percent, Auckland City Council, New  Zealand Superannuation Fund and infrastructure investor Infratil. All have indicated they are unlikely to sell their holdings. Auckland Airport Chief Executive Don Huse said the outlook remains positive, helped by airlines making commitments to add capacity on key routes. \"Passenger growth is returning to the long-term trend. The outlook for the airlines is certainly positive and they are making commitments to new capacity,\" Huse told a media briefing. Huse expects revenue improvements across the business in the current  fiscal year, with growth in retail, car park, rental property as well as passenger numbers and aeronautical income.

These are the findings of an absenteeism management report on the subject by Port Elizabeth-based AIC Insurance.  The research was conducted in 60 South African companies, on 7000 employees, over the course of one year. \"The female absenteeism rate is higher than males (2.7 percent versus 2.1 percent) and females have on average 27 percent more one  day illnesses compared to males,\" AIC Insurance chief executive Johnny Johnson said. \"This may support the popular view that they are using sick leave in lieu of family responsibility leave. For example, if their  children are sick and they need to spend time at home nursing them.\" The survey found that females have 14 percent more psychological  illnesses, such as depression and stress, than males and 55 percent  more neurological illnesses, such as migraines and headaches. \"It could be argued that working mothers have more family responsibilities than their male counterparts -- which can lead to increased stress and depression,\" Johnson said. Johnson said that neurological illnesses, such as headaches and migraines, were largely difficult to dispute and a larger portion of the abuse or opportunistic sick leave fell into this category.  \"However, this is an assumption and it could be that females are  more prone to this type of illness,\" he said. What the survey showed, Johnson said, was that employers should consider offering the right support structures to their female staff so that stress and depression are minimised. Johnson said employers should ensure that working women with family responsibilities did not have to abuse the system in order to get the leave they need to resolve family issues. \"They can do this by having the correct policies and procedures in place that allow for this type of time off, by offering in-house  child care facilities, by having flexible working hours or by simply being understanding to their female staff with these kinds of needs,\" he said.

DA spokesperson on public enterprises Natasha Mazzone said she had laid charges in September 2017 against Maine and Joe Singh from Just Coal after the latter confirmed that R500,000 was paid to the ANCYL in anticipation of an extension to a coal contract with Eskom. She said the 2014 contract to supply Eskom with coal was terminated in 2016, despite this payment to the ANCYL. \"In their letter to me, the Hawks state that there is 'no reasonable prospect of successful prosecution' because there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegations that the R500,000 was paid to the ANCYL 'to assist in receiving a further Eskom contract',\" said Mazzone. \"But this only poses the obvious question, why would Just Coal give R500,000 to the ANCYL?

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive will clarify its rules to require anyone engaged in the business of selling firearms, regardless of the location, to have a license and conduct background checks. It does not target private sales by hobbyists or collectors and stops short of setting a number of guns that must be involved to require a seller to register as a gun dealer. The top Republican lawmaker in Congress denounced the efforts as intimidation of law-abiding gun owners. \"Rather than focus on criminals and terrorists, he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens. His words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty,\" Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said. The bid to require more gun sellers to have a license is unnecessary because those who make a living selling guns are already required to do so under existing law, Ryan claimed. Obama is also seeking to eliminate a loophole that allowed gun buyers to avoid background checks if they were acting through a trust or other legal entity. The executive action, a means of circumventing Congress, also seeks to improve the federal background check system with more information on criminal and mental health records and by hiring more examiners to process background checks. Obama is also proposing 200 additional gun enforcement agents, 500 million dollars for mental health services and additional research on safe gun technology. Obama's efforts to enact tougher gun control laws following the mass shooting of students at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut were blocked by Congress and his calls for similar measures following subsequent shootings have failed to gain traction. He has instead been forced to rely on a series of executive actions, which do not carry the force of law and can easily be reversed by future presidents.

Roger Federer ensured he didn't have too late a night on Rod Laver Arena, beating David Goffin 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 to advance to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park.The four-time Australian Open champion didn't get on court until 10:45 p.m. because of to late-finishing matches in the afternoon and a subsequent delayed start to the night program. But the third-seeded Federer raced through the match in 1 hour, 28 minutes, finishing up shortly after midnight. Federer plays No. 6-seeded Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals. ___ 10:30 p.m. Tenth-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro overcame a seriously slow start to rebound for a 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Russian-born Australian Daria Gavrilova and reach the quarterfinals. Buoyed by a partisan capacity crowd of 15,000 at Rod Laver Arena, Gavrilova won the first set in 25 minutes. But the Spanish player, using a vast array of shots, dominated the last two sets with five service breaks and dropping just one service game. Suarez Navarro will play No. 4-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska in the quarterfinals. ___ 9 p.m. Fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanksa has advanced to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park with a 6-7 (6), 6-1, 7-5 win over Anna-Lena Friedsam, who suffered from severe cramping and was in tears for the last two games. Friedsam was given a time warning and then a point penalty in her last service game, conceding the game to Radwanska and a 6-5 lead. Radwanska then held serve to clinch the match despite trailing 5-2 in the final set.

Djokovic advanced to the final eight and a match Tuesday against Kei Nishikori despite making a whopping 100 unforced errors, including four backhand drop shots into the net as he attempted, unsuccessfully, to get Simon to move up from his anchored position on the baseline. The five-time champion Djokovic and the pesky Simon played plenty of long rallies \u2014 the longest of which was 37 strokes. Simon frustrated Djokovic with his defensive play, saving all 11 break-point opportunities in the second set before dominating the tiebreaker. Overall, Simon saved 19 of 25 break points. ___ 5 p.m. Nigel Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanovic and father-in-law of Andy Murray, is expected to be released from a Melbourne hospital later Sunday, a day after he collapsed in Rod Laver Arena during Ivanovic's third-round match. The Australian Open released a statement from Sears in which he says he's been \"cleared to fly back home to the U.K. in the next day or so.\" Ivanovic's match against Madison Keys was halted for about an hour on Saturday night while medics attended to Sears in the stands. He was carried out of the arena on a stretcher and taken to a hospital. Ivanovic had just won the first set when the match was stopped, but Keys came back to win in three sets. Murray was playing at the same time at Margaret Court Arena, and after he finished his match, he rushed to the hospital to check on Sears, who is the father of his wife, Kim. Murray's wife, Kim, is due to give birth to their first child next month. ___ 4:40 p.m. Now, Lleyton Hewitt's career as a professional tennis player really has ended. The 34-year-old Australian player had announced he would retire after this year's Australian Open. A center court ceremony was held for him Thursday night after he lost his second-round singles match to David Ferrer. The next day he was back in action in doubles with countryman Sam Groth. On Sunday, the Australian duo lost their third-round doubles match to Jack Sock and Vasek Pospisil, 6-4, 6-2. Hewitt walked off the court and into retirement to a standing ovation in the 7,500-seat Margaret Court Arena The match was interrupted for 20 minutes during the second set due to a medical issue in the stands that required medics to enter the arena. It was the third time this tournament that matches have been interrupted due to medical situations in the stands. ___ 3:35 p.m. Nick Kyrgios won't be sanctioned by tournament officials for answering his phone on court before a mixed doubles match at the Australian Open because the call was taken before the pre-match meeting. Kyrgios answered the mobile phone call, which he said was from a friend, before a match he and his girlfriend, Ajla Tomljanovic, lost in straight sets to the No.1-ranked team of Ivan Dodig and Sania Mirza on Saturday. Under the ATP Tour policy \"a player is not allowed to use any electronic devices (e.g. C.D. players, mobile phones, etc.) during matches, unless approved by the supervisor.\" The Australian Open released a statement on Sunday saying, \"(the) referee reviewed the situation ... as Nick walked on to the court before his match he answered a phone call then hung up. This happened prior to the pre-match meeting and no further action wil be taken. The incident has been closed.\" ___ 2:40 p.m. Six-time and defending champion Serena Williams is through to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park after a 6-2, 6-1 win over Russian Margarita Gasparyan on Rod Laver Arena in 55 minutes. Under bright sunshine after the roof was opened following morning rain, Williams lost her service in the opening game but quickly found her groove to set up a rematch of last year's final with Maria Sharapova, who defeated Belinda Bencic in the preceding match. Williams has beaten Sharapova in 18 of 20 matches and hasn't lost to Sharapova since 2004. ___ 1:30 p.m. Kei Nishikori is the first male player through to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park, defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 in front of a hugely partisan crowd filled with flag-waving Japanese fans. The seventh-seeded Nishikori also reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open last year and in 2012. Nishikori has had trouble with Tsonga's power game in the past, losing most recently to the Frenchman in the quarterfinals of the French Open last year. But Tsonga lost his serve five times in the match and only managed to break Nishikori once. The match was played under the roof at Hisense Arena after early-morning rain that delayed the start of other matches on side courts. ___ 1:20 p.m. Maria Sharapova is through to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open after a 7-5, 7-5 win over Belinda Bencic of Switzerland. The fifth-seeded Sharapova needed 2 hours, 5 minutes to beat Bencic, breaking the Swiss player's serve for the fourth time in the last game \u2014 sealing it when she successfully challenged a call on the baseline on the opposite end of the court. Sharapova, the 2008 champion and a three-time runner-up, needed four set points to clinch the opening set, including two in the 10th game. Bencic again found herself on the wrong end of an opponent's ace count. Sharapova had 21, including four on her second serve. Last year, Bencic was on the receiving end of a WTA-record 27 aces from Sabine Lisicki. ___ 11:15 a.m. Light rain is delaying the start of play on outdoor courts at Melbourne Park on Sunday, although matches on three covered stadiums have begun as scheduled. First up on Rod Laver Arena is Maria Sharapova's fourth-round match against Belinda Bencic. That will be followed by defending champion Serena Williams' match against Russian Margarita Gasparyan. Defending men's champion Novak Djokovic closes the afternoon program on the main court when he plays Gilles Simon. Roger Federer plays a night match on Rod Laver against David Goffin.","label":0}

They need also to export most of their gas, of course,\" Steinitz said on Wednesday. In late January, Tel Aviv, Nicosia and Athens agreed to work on joint projects to export gas from the Eastern Mediterranean's gas reserves discovered in the seas belonging to Israel and Cyprus to Europe. Ankara has been in talks with Israeli firms over a potential pipeline to carry Israeli natural gas to Turkey for several years, but the negotiations reached an impasse as relations between the two countries deteriorated. Relations between Israel and Turkey deteriorated after the Freedom Flotilla incident in 2010, when a convoy of six ships, including one under Turkey's flag, tried to approach the Gaza Strip with humanitarian aid and activists on board. The flotilla was blocked and stormed by Israeli forces, with eight Turkish citizens being killed. Currently, Israel's Leviathan gas field, first drilled in 2011, is one of the largest young gas reserves in the world, with some 3,450 trillion cubic meters of natural gas of undiscovered reserves.","label":0}

The reactor shut down due to a fault on the turbine control system which has since been repaired, he said. Eskom managing director Jacob Maroga said no interruptions to power supply had been experienced while Koeberg Unit 2 was not generating electricity. The station's other reactor, Koeberg Unit 1, was running at full  power and supply of electricity to the Cape was being augmented by Eskom's \"peaking stations\" during the time the reactor was down. Stott said the incident was unusual in that it had shut the whole system down.

The special investigation committee probing the whereabouts of Japanese nationals abducted by DPRK agents decades ago \"will be dissolved from Feb. 12, 2016,\" said a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. The decision was made apparently in response to Japan's new sanctions against the DPRK adopted Wednesday following its fourth nuclear test and rocket launch. The new sanctions include banning the re-entry from the DPRK of Japan-based foreign nuclear or missile engineers, banning ships from third countries that have visited ports in the DPRK, and banning remittances of over 100,000 yen (about 870 U.S. dollars) to the DPRK in principle, except for humanitarian cases. These sanctions had been partially lifted under the Stockholm agreement signed between Japan and the DPRK in mid-2014, but Japan has \"reneged on its commitments made in the agreement\" and \"made a frontal challenge to the DPRK,\" the statement said. The statement also warned that Japan's hostile acts will entail strong countermeasures from the DPRK and that the Japanese government will \"hold full responsibilities\" for such consequences. The DPRK acknowledged in 2002 that it had abducted 13 Japanese nationals in the 1970s and 1980s. Talks on the issue were shelved in December 2012, when the country launched a long-range missile. Under an agreement reached in May 2014 in Stockholm, the DPRK would reopen the probe into the abductions, and in return Japan would ease sanctions against the DPRK. In July 2014, the DPRK announced the establishment of a special investigation committee tasked with probing the fate of these Japanese nationals, who were allegedly kidnapped to become spies. The committee, composed of about 30 officials, had four panels in Pyongyang and branches in other cities and counties across the country. Enditem","label":0}

Not only did they again achieve a 100% matric pass rate but, more importantly, 81.81% of them earned matriculation exemption and will therefore be able to continue their studies at a university. Last year only 77.6% qualified for matriculation exemption. With six distinctions Micah Fernandez, a learner from Kenya, is the school's top performer. He achieved distinctions in Mathematics (87%), Life Orientation (86%), CAT (93%), Geography (92%), Life Sciences (81%) and Physical Sciences (81%). Fernandez represented Kenya at the World Junior Swimming Championships in Singapore. The 35 matriculants of TuksSport High School achieved a total of 37 distinctions. Principal Hettie de Villiers is adamant that good academic results are as important for the learners as excelling on the different sports fields. \"For me personally, it is even more important to achieve good academic results. I always place much emphasis on the fact that any sports career, no matter how good the athlete is, can last only a few years. \"If you look at the spelling of the name of our school \u2013 TuksSport High School \u2013 you will notice that both Tuks and Sport are written in capital letters.

I hope there is no one who has been here for the  thirteenth or fourteenth year but if there is, it means they have stayed the course, they were patient and they have never allowed anybody else to determine  who they are and to tell them that they are failures.  They basically focused on the end goal which is passing Grade 12. I want to congratulate you for that and I want you to clap hands for yourselves for having made it. I studied here, I completed my Matric here.   I was taught by the teachers here, *Mme* Sesona taught me Sepedi. I saw Mr Mononyane who taught me biology. Bra Cheeks (that's what we called him behind his back) he taught me English. There are some teachers who are still here like  Mr Machabaphala, he taught me Afrikaans and Maths.  There are some others who are still here but I did not do accounting but they taught Accounting like Ms Mosue.  There are still the same people who about more or less twenty years ago who taught me are still teaching you.   It means that you have got no excuse, you cannot blame anybody else. It means that you have yourself to push yourself, to push the limits to make sure that you complete this marathon. If you started in Grade R or Grade 1 twelve years later you are here, it means that you can move beyond this hurdle.  I want to ask you three questions, which I think are very important questions and will determine what I will say after you have responded these questions  The first question is  Have you applied at a university or FET College or a university of technology?  Learners: Yes  Ok, that is very important. It is important because once you have applied it  means that you do not want to remain here. You do not want to be wearing the same golf shirt, it is a very nice golf shirt but you do not want to be wearing  it next year again. There are projects to build more schools because there is overcrowding. We don't want a situation where you become part of overcrowding because you are repeating. We want you to pass; we want you to go to university, a university of technology or to an FET college.  When I left here I went to study in Mamelodi in a Further Education and Training college. I went to study electronics. For now that is not needed in the Union Buildings but it laid a basis for me.  So whatever you do -you may not be admitted at a university but you can still go to a university of technology or to an FET college.  In fact if you go to an FET institution to go and study whatever you want to  study and you qualify, you can actually study for free. I don't know if you have known that.  The second question, remember I said three questions, the second question is  If you have applied at university or the other institutions of higher learning have you applied for bursaries?  There is something called the National Student Financial Aid Scheme which government provides. It is part bursary and part loan. It means a certain portion of the money that government pays for your tuition fees is free if you pass all your subjects.  Also I had a meeting yesterday with the chairperson of the National Youth Development Agency. I told him I am going to a school which I studied at and at  that school there will also be learners from Solomon Mahlangu High School.  I asked him what I should tell you. He said that I should tell you they have  what they call the Solomon Mahlangu scholarship. For the students in Phagameng,  Solomon Maglangu, Sedibeng and Mohlakamotala high schools the top 3 learners will receive a full scholarship.  It means that you must work hard. If we have even better results, I'm sure we can tell the NYDA to give us more scholarships. It is all about us making sure that we perform much better. The scholarship includes everything from tuition, transport, study material etc. They have priority subjects which are part of the scarce skills, which means you will have to either be an actuarial scientist or a statistician or any of those scarce skills that the NYDA has identified. We also need more Doctors and more engineers. The MMC for economic development was reminding me that I studied electronics engineering. I am yet to apply it.  The beautiful thing about being from here, not only Phagameng, Modimolle but  also being from Limpopo is that we are stepping on the footsteps of people who have done great things in the country.  Last week the President announced the governor of the Reserve Bank, *Ntate* Leseja Kganyago. He is from Limpopo and he will be signing the money. That means when we have money it will have the signature of Leseja Kganyago.  He is a product of this province and many others are as well.  Ms Madela was telling us this morning how we have so many people from this region and how beautiful our region is so we need to step into those footsteps of those people who have made a mark for themselves.  Many of those couldn't have done that without going through school. We have many examples of people who have succeeded in life even though they did not pass Martic, but many people needed the foundation of Form Five, or Martic, or Grade twelve in your case to make sure that they do all they want to do, which leads me to the third question that I want to ask you.  Have you decided what you want to do after passing matric?  Learners: Yes  In fact that is even wonderful because if you do not know what you want to do after passing your matric you may actually not pass your Matric because you don't know what you want to do after Martic.  Once you have decided that - you may want to be a lawyer, a doctor or an actor. Do you know Florence Masebe? She  went to the University of Cape Town to study acting.  It is not only a natural talent, but she went to study to be an actor. You also know DJ Fresh? He went to Boston College to study to be a DJ. So all these  people that you see on TV, It is also about their natural talent they went to study.  Our President - they always mock him and joke about the fact that he didn't go to school. He didn't have the opportunity that you have to go to school.  We cannot make excuses and say the President did not go to school. In fact he fought very hard that you will have the opportunity to go to school.  You cannot use those kinds of excuses to try and get out of going to school.  Everyone is looking at you. Come the first day of examinations, everybody will be looking at you.  Forget about other pressures rather focus on the end goal. Ensure that you look at what lies ahead of Grade 12.  I'm sure the twelve years have been very long, you do not want to come back here, you want to go to university or an FET college, you want to go and study further. You also want to make sure that you make your mark.  You don't want to be that person when we go bury you we say \"so and so was born he lived and he died\"  There is no full stop no comma, no paragraph, nothing! You want to make sure  we really mean it when we say we miss you. You don't want a situation where your friends don't want to talk to you because you have become a burden. We want you to take this country forward.  Bra Cheeks, Ms Mosue and the Principal are old now. They need people to replace them, don't worry Sadtu will ensure that teachers are paid better (laughter). We need all of you to come and make South Africa a better place.  I heard that we are targeting 85% pass rate. This means that we must have 100% pass rate at Phagameng and Solomon Mahlangu High Schools. I wish you all the best and I'm sure that with the way in which you are going to pass will put  more pressure on the NYDA to increase the number of bursaries so that we have all of these professions in Phagameng and throughout Modimolle.  Thank you  Ends \/avb","label":0}
{"id":"5db56b78ee1f20001746365a","url":"SAPAI-ff9c076326-79483.txt","text":"ESTIMATES By PAUL ELIAS Chiron Corp. said Wednesday it will not deliver as many flu shots this year as it had promised, prompting the beleaguered biotechnology company to cut its 2005 financial forecast. The California-based company, one of only two major makers of the U.S. flu vaccine, caused a public health scare in the United States in October when it failed to deliver 50 million shots at the  beginning of flu season because of manufacturing problems. That was  about half the nation's expected vaccine supply. Chiron said its Liverpool, England factory is still plagued with  problems and that it now plans to produce 18 million to 26 million doses of its Fluvirin vaccine for the 2005-2006 season, down from a  previous forecast of 25 million to 30 million doses. Since the company's high-profile failure was announced in October, its stock has fallen more than 20 percent. Meanwhile, other drug makers are attempting to enter a U.S. flu vaccine market  that was previously locked up by Chiron and the French pharmaceutical Sanofi-Aventis SA. Analysts said London-based GlaxoSmithKline could sell as many as  10 million flu shots in the United States this flu season if the Food and Drug Administration approves its marketing application. Sanofi is expected to supply 60 million shots and the biotechnology  company MedImmune Inc. of Gaithersburg, Md. is expected to provide 3 million doses of its nasal spray vaccine. Chiron's stock was down {dollar}2.84, or 7.5 percent, to {dollar}35.11 a share  in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company also cut its 2005 earnings forecast to 86 cents to {dollar}1.11 per share from {dollar}1.06 to {dollar}1.16 per share. \"While it remains possible that we will reach our previously announced range, the delays and other manufacturing issues have had  an adverse impact on our ramp-up to full production,\" Chiron chief executive Howard Pien said. Last August, Pien announced that Chiron had found 4 million tainted flu shots in its Liverpool factory, but still intended to ship about 46 million doses to the United States. At the time, U.S.  health officials said they were confident the nation's vaccine supply wasn't in jeopardy. But on Oct. 5, British regulators shut down the factory and prohibited Chiron from shipping any vaccine - a move that caught U.S. health officials by surprise just as the nation's flu season was starting. Since then, October has struggled to repair its tarnished image and regain the confidence of U.S. health officials. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman didn't immediately return a telephone call Wednesday. The company faces myriad federal investigations and investor lawsuits because of its failure. The mishap cost the company an estimated {dollar}300 million in lost sales, and Chiron took a {dollar}91 million  charge in the third quarter last year because of the vaccine debacle. In March, British officials said the company could resume vaccine making, but the FDA still needs to inspect the plant before  Chiron can ship shots to the United States. The FDA, which plans a July inspection, could still bar Chiron from the U.S. market if it's not satisfied with its manufacturing practices. Pien relinquished the title of president in February and wasn't given an annual bonus in 2004 according to regulatory filings. He received a {dollar}1.5 million bonus in 2003. Meanwhile, flu experts and government officials are meeting in Memphis Friday to develop new production and distribution schemes for flu vaccine to avoid another Chiron-like debacle.

She has demanded that it be published in its entirety and addressed it also for the attention of the Press Ombudsman.  Please note that should you wish to publish any of the content in this statement from Walter, you are specifically advised to FIRST CHECK THIS WITH YOUR LEGAL ADVISOR.   Sapa is circulating this text to only its closed-access group of content subscribers. The unabridged statement of Walter, as well as the text of a letter giving notice of legal action against SARS, follows:    -----  Members of the Media, Press Ombud, Editors   THIS RESPONSE SHOULD BE PUBLISHED IN ITS ENTIRETY  Given the fact that journalists have seen fit to publish lengthy articles defaming me, it would be appreciated if they take the time and effort to publish my response in its entirety and, where required, do some actual investigation!  I refer to numerous and intrusive requests from the media to provide a response to the ridiculous and defamatory article published by Jacques Pauw, City Press and Rapport on Sunday, 10 August 2014.  Due to the fact that I will be pursuing legal action, I would request that you accept this statement, verify your facts (for a change) and thereafter leave me in peace as your continued harassment is causing distress to my family, particularly my aged parents and my minor son.  I also place on record that a job offer was withdrawn this morning as a result of your defamatory and false articles.  On the evening of Thursday, 7 August 2014, I received an email from Jacques  Pauw containing outlandish, ridiculous and spurious statements and questions.  The email\/questions were riddled with falsehoods and matters of which I was not, and am still not personally aware.  I did not respond to the email as it was impossible in my mind that a credible journalist could have any evidence or information of substance in asking such questions.  I was also provided with less than 18 hours to respond to information which it would appear Mr Pauw would have received weeks in advance considering the lengthy article as published in the Rapport and City Press on Sunday, 10 August  2014.  The questions related to a confidential complaint lodged by me with the South African Revenue Services (\"SARS\") and which relies on evidence of over 600 pages of whatsap messages and numerous other exchanges, communications and notes, which would conservatively exceed 1000 pages. To attempt to unravel the journalist's grossly out of context extracts and false information would take several days. I also feel it necessary to place on record that Jacques Pauw is known to me to have a personal and historical close and improper relationship with Johann van Loggerenberg.  This was hi-lighted in a 43-page document providing detailed information to the SARS \"Panel\" relating to the formal complaints I made to the SARS Anti-Corruption Unit, SARS Acting Commissioner, Mr Ivan Pillay, and Senior Manager, Mr Gene Ravele  on 2 June 2014.  I intend to issue a summons for defamation against Mr Jacques Pauw, his editors, City Press, Rapport, Johann van Loggerenberg and SARS. To this end, I enclose a copy of my formal notification to SARS of my intention to proceed formally as required in terms of the Tax Administration Act, 2011.  I invite the media to pay close and careful attention in their investigations to Mr Johann van Loggerenberg himself. To illustrate the unprofessional conduct of Mr Pauw, I draw your attention to the following:  A. Jacques Pauw's interest and illegal receipt of confidential taxpayer information and other false information from Johann van Loggerenberg for publication in the media;  B. Jacques Pauw's longstanding relationship with Johann van Loggerenberg's so-called charity - Wachizungu Sawa Sawa (www.wachizungu.com) - see http:\/\/www.wachizungu.com\/139207979) (the media may also wish to pay close and careful attention to the donor's list);  C. The correct spelling of Johann van Loggerenberg of SARS' surname. The correct details are as follows - Johannes Hendrikus van Loggerenberg. (ID - 690212 5005 083) and residing at 96 Leadwood Crescent, Moreleta Park, Pretoria;  D. SARS misrepresents the spelling of Johann van Loggerenberg's surname to both taxpayers and the media intermittently. It is interesting that no member of the press has bothered to investigate the reason for this (See section 10, read with section 6 of the Tax Administration Act, 2011);  E. Johann van Loggerenberg was a trained deep cover operative with the RS programme, having a number RS 536 (see public document - LLB thesis by Johann van Loggerenberg at the University of the Free State).  It is interesting that no member of the press has bothered to investigate the reason for his withdrawal from the programme, and how it came to be that Johann van Loggerenberg jumped from a very low ranking official in the South African Police Service to his position at the South African Revenue Services.  Also Johann van Loggerenberg sought not to have his picture published in conjunction with the Selebi trial but publishes it ad nauseum on his website and Facebook site, in conjunction with his full name.  Why is it that my picture was sprawled all over the newspapers but not a single picture of Johann van Loggerenberg was published. Pictures of Johann van  Loggerenberg can so easily be obtained (see Google, Images, www.wachizungu.comor Wachizungu Sawa Sawa on Facebook).  Should any media representatives wish to run a fair article and require photographs of Johann van Loggerenberg please feel free to ask me.  In short, I respond to the false and ridiculous allegations against me as follows. Please note that this is not intended to be a full or comprehensive response and I reserve my right to expand and clarify in the future should it become necessary:   1. I submit that through a series of events that will form part of the evidence in my action against SARS and Johann van Loggerenberg, I was \"groomed\"  by Johann van Loggerenberg (in the same manner as a paedophile grooms a child) through the use of my communications, illegally intercepted by SARS itself.  Johann van Loggerenberg did not accidentally befriend me or manage a conversation so that I playfully asked him out on a date. Johann van Loggerenberg is not a \"victim\" and at all times was fully aware of my history both personally and professionally;   2. I have laid criminal complaints with the Hawks relating to various nefarious conduct of Johann van Loggerenberg and SARS and such complaints should be investigated and if found to be valid, I trust that prosecution will follow. I will not be swayed or \"broken\" by the numerous attacks against me currently being orchestrated by Johann van Loggerenberg. I am steadfast in my convictions and have always been;   3. I have already several weeks ago submitted all my communication devices to the Hawks for independent and credible securing of all data and information as I am aware that Johann van Loggerenberg and\/or SARS will attempt to deny and\/or fabricate evidence as this devious method or manner in his other investigations was disclosed to me by Johann van Loggerenberg (and as is documented in various allegations and actions historically);   4. I will be submitting to a polygraph test to verify various other information\/evidence as presented and to refute the ridiculous claims in the media. I invite Johann van Loggerenberg and other SARS officials to submit themselves to the same;   more \/ks","label":0}

Two and a half years after it sank off the island of Giglio in a nighttime disaster that left 32 people dead, the plan is to raise and tow away the 114,500-tonne vessel in an unprecedented and delicate operation. \"The most critical phase will be the first day, raising the wreck for the first time. Refloating a passenger ship this large has never been attempted before,\" South African Nick Sloane, who is in charge of the salvage, told AFP. The 290-metre (950-foot) ship was rotated upright in September and is now sitting on an underwater platform. Thirty tanks or \"sponsons\" that have been welded to the sides will work as a  pneumatic system to raise it. Under the gaze of the world's media, the operation is expected to start on Monday with workers pumping compressed air into the sponsons to lift the Concordia by two metres. The environmental committee overseeing the operation gave a preliminary go-ahead on Saturday but said that final confirmation would come on Sunday, depending on the weather. The operation is to begin at 6:00 am (0400 GMT) on Monday. In a worst-case scenario, some environmentalists warn the hull could break apart and spill its rotting innards into what is one of Europe's largest marine  sanctuaries. \"We're talking about a floating city kitted out for thousands of passengers,  with gallons of pollutants such as oils, detergents and sewage chemicals still inside,\" said Giorgia Monti from Greenpeace, which is sending an observation team to monitor the operation. After the initial lift, tug boats would drag the wreck 30 metres (32 yards) east and secure it in place before it is slowly buoyed another 10 metres, with engineers checking each deck for fresh structural damage as they emerge. All maritime traffic in the area -- which includes a popular beach resort --  will be blocked during the most delicate phases. A team of experts will manage the operation from a control room under the guidance of Sloane, who has described the salvage as his \"most challenging\" yet  in a career that has taken him to six continents and two warzones. Ship owner Costa Crociere said on Saturday that the whole procedure is expected to take six or seven days. \"The departure of the Concordia from Giglio is currently scheduled for July 21,\" the company said in a statement. \"It is a complex operation never attempted before, but we know we can count on the best technicians in the world,\" Costa Crociere's chief executive Michael  Thamm was quoted as saying. Salvage operators were expected to deliver a technical briefing on Giglio Island on Sunday but they have already said the Concordia would be towed at two  knots an hour some 240 kilometres (149 miles) north to the port of Genoa. It is expected to arrive later this month to be scrapped near the same shipyard it was built and launched in 2006. Salvage costs so far are estimated at around 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion), including 100 million euros for the scrapping. The luxury liner -- twice the size of the Titanic -- crashed into rocks just  off tiny Giglio island in January 2012 and keeled over with 4,229 people from 70 countries on board. The ship's captain Francesco Schettino is currently on trial for manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, and abandoning the vessel before all of the passengers had been evacuated. Four other crew members and a Costa Crociere executive have plea-bargained and the company has accepted limited responsibility as Schettino's employer. The body of one of the victims, Indian waiter Russel Rebello, is still missing and his remains may be found during the refloating or dismantling of the vessel. The four-day journey to Genoa is fraught with possible environmental hazards, with warnings that some of the 100 tonnes of fuel and 263,000 cubic metres (69.5 million gallons) of polluted water flooding its lower decks could leak out. Costa Crociere insists the amount of leakage will be comparable to that discharged by any vessel crossing the area -- one of the most trafficked in the  Mediterranean. Sapa-AFP \/mjs","label":0}

Irving scored 26 points for Cleveland, which overcame a gritty effort by the Pistons in Detroit's first home playoff game since 2009. Andre Drummond scored 17 points for the Pistons, but Detroit fell behind toward the end of the third quarter, and a late rally came up short. The Cavs lead the series 3-0, with Game 4 coming up Sunday night. Down by nine in the fourth, Detroit went on an 8-0 run, forcing the Cavs to call a timeout. Irving responded with a 3-pointer, and J.R. Smith added one of his own to make it 95-90. Irving made it an eight-point game with a 3-pointer in the final minute. Detroit rookie Stanley Johnson, who seemed eager to get into a verbal battle with James and the Cavs after Game 2, scored nine points in a fearless first half Friday, but James had the final word before halftime, making a jumper with less than a second left in the second quarter to give Cleveland a 54-53 lead. Cleveland methodically built a 79-73 lead after three quarters, and after a three-point play and a 3-pointer by James early in the fourth, the Cavs were up by nine. It was 87-86 after Detroit's run, but the 3s by Irving and Smith helped Cleveland hold on. Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Memphis Grizzlies 96-87 to take a 3-0 lead in its Western Conference first-round series. The Spurs are a win away from their ninth postseason series sweep and third against Memphis. They finished the game on a 13-6 run in the final 3:41, and Leonard, the two-time Defensive Player of the Year, scored 13 points in the quarter as he shot 11 of 22 for the game and 6 of 9 from 3-point range. LaMarcus Aldridge added 16 points and 10 rebounds. Danny Green and Manu Ginobili each added 11 points for San Antonio. Zach Randolph led Memphis with 20 points and 11 rebounds on 6-of-21 shooting, while Matt Barnes added 17 points and 11 rebounds. Game 4 is Sunday. Isaiah Thomas scored a career-high 42 points, and the Boston Celtics held on to beat the Atlanta Hawks 111-103 in Game 3 of its Eastern Conference first-round series. Evan Turner, inserted into the starting lineup, had 17 points and seven assists. Amir Johnson added 15 points and seven rebounds as the Celtics closed to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Playing by far their best first half of the series, Boston led by as many as 20 points before seeing that mostly erased by a 12-0 run by the Hawks in the third quarter. The Celtics then survived a frenetic fourth quarter that featured three ties and a pair of lead changes, finally getting separation with five straight points for a 104-98 lead. Jeff Teague had 23 points for Atlanta. Kent Bazemore and Dennis Schroder each finished with 20.","label":0}

{"id":"5db56b78ee1f200017463725","url":"SAPAI-5b7aab2047-93084.txt","text":"(PICTURE) Societe Generale chairman Daniel Bouton faced increasing pressure from French officials to answer for the rogue trader disaster rocking the bank ahead a meeting Wednesday of its board of directors. As questions swirled over Societe Generale's failure to prevent a junior trader racking up losses of 4.8 billion euros (7.1 billion dollars), Finance Minister Christine Lagarde stressed on Tuesday it was  \"up to board members\" to decide on Bouton's future. \"Societe Generale is in crisis,\" she said, adding that \"the board members are there to decide whether or not the person in charge is the best one to steer the ship or if a change of captain is needed.\" The head of the French Senate finance committee, Jean Arthuis, went further: \"I don't think Bouton has any choice but to leave.\" Societe Generale's board turned down the 57-year-old Bouton's offer of resignation last week, after the colossal losses were announced, asking him to steer the bank through the crisis. One of the best paid French executives, with a salary of 3.3 million  euros in 2006, Bouton said he would forego six months' pay and reaffirmed on Monday that his offer to resign was still on the table. But as the French government stepped in to warn market predators away from the crisis-hit bank, seen increasingly as a takeover target, the decision to keep Bouton in place came under scrutiny. President Nicolas Sarkozy zeroed in on Bouton's role as head of the chain of command on Monday. \"I don't like to carry personal judgement on people, especially when  they are in trouble.\" \"But we are in a system where, when you have a big salary, which is without doubt legitimate, and there is a big problem, you cannot escape  your responsibilities,\" he said. According to the business daily La Tribune, the government was ruffled by the impression of \"impunity\" given to top executives at the bank. Across the Atlantic, Citigroup chief Charles Prince lost his job in October as the world's top banking group announced multi-billion-dollar  losses linked to the subprime mortgage crisis. Earlier that month, the global investment bank Merrill Lynch ousted chairman Stan O'Neal after posting some of the biggest losses in its 93-year history. France's third biggest bank by market capitalisation, Societe Generale has blamed its colossal losses on junior trader Jerome Kerviel, 31, who was charged Monday for a series of offences -- but not  fraud as the bank had claimed. Bouton, who joined Societe Generale in 1991, taking over as chairman  seven years later, has rejected accusations by Kerviel's lawyers that the bank was looking for a fall guy to cover its managerial failings. But there has been considerable scepticism about the possibility of a junior trader to evade controls without management's acquiescence, with Kerviel telling prosecutors his bosses must have been aware he placed tens of billions of euros in risky futures trades. \"I remain convinced that they knew about my positions,\" Kerviel was quoted as saying in leaked records of his questioning at the weekend. \"It is impossible to generate that kind of profit with small positions.\" In a letter to clients, Bouton insisted Societe Generale would rebound and had a bright future ahead. But the Societe Generale case dwarfs that of Nick Leeson, who lost 1.5 billion dollars as a Singapore-based trader at Barings, causing the  collapse of the British bank in 1995. This latest crisis all but wiped out the bank's 2007 profit and left  it as a potential takeover target, with France's top two banks BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole said to be poised to pounce. Prime Minister Francois Fillon vowed Tuesday to defend the bank against \"hostile raids\" on the stock market, but Sarkozy was reportedly  angered not to have been informed sooner of the looming crisis, according to Le Monde newspaper. Pressure on the bank has been compounded by allegations of insider trading linked to share sales by an American board member, Robert Day, prompting three shareholder groups to take legal action -- allegations denied by the bank.

The Bill would now be submitted to Parliament for enactment, government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe told reporters in Pretoria. The bill was aimed at securing tenure rights on communally held land. Traditional leaders last year warned of possible bloodshed if the legislation was approved.  In July this year, National House of Traditional Leaders (NHTL) chairman Mpiyezintobi Mzimela lambasted the bill and said there could be no traditional leadership without communal land. Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has described it as \"the final destruction\" of the Zulu monarchy and traditional leadership. Netshitenzhe was unsure whether parliamentary committees would be able to consider the bill this year, but said it would be processed as urgently as possible. He added there should be no problems in getting it enacted, despite objections. \"One does not expect that there would be major issues that would  delay the passing of the legislation.\" The Cabinet endorsed a commitment that the government would consider amending the Constitution should the need for this become clear from ongoing discussions on the white paper and framework bill on traditional leaders. The commitment was given by President Thabo Mbeki during recent talks with traditional leaders on the matter. Mzimela demanded in April that the Constitution be amended to guarantee the status and powers of traditional leaders. Wednesday's Cabinet meeting also endorsed an undertaking to refer proposals for the creation of a continent-wide house of traditional leaders to the African Union. It furthermore committed the government to attending to calls for better infrastructure for the NHTL. Sapa","label":0}

Tuesday's outcomes would have been nearly unthinkable not long ago. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, easily beat Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and first lady once seen as the all-but-certain Democratic nominee. While Clinton remains the favorite in the national race, the win by the Vermont senator could be a springboard into a competitive, drawn-out campaign. With more than 90 percent of the vote counted, Sanders had 60 percent to Clinton's 38 percent. He swept majorities of men, independents and young people. And Sanders and Clinton were evenly divided among women, a major setback for a candidate who aims to become the nation's first female president. For Trump, the brash real estate billionaire and television personality who has never held public office, the win was an important rebound after his loss to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in last week's Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest. Trump has led national polls for months, and the New Hampshire victory proves he can win votes and gives credibility to his upstart populist candidacy. Trump had 35 percent, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich a distant second with 16 percent. \"We are going to make America so great again,\" Trump told a raucous crowd. \"Maybe greater than ever before.\" For some Republican leaders, back-to-back victories by Trump and Cruz, an uncompromising conservative, add urgency to the need to coalesce around a more mainstream candidate. Tuesday's vote did little to clarify who that might be. Kasich, a more moderate Republican, poured nearly all of his campaign resources into the state. He pointed to his largely positive approach, saying, \"Light overcame the darkness.\" Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio vied for third place along with Cruz, ensuring all would press on to the next contest \u2014 the Feb. 20 South Carolina primary. The state is a hotbed of conservative tea party groups and evangelical voters that will test Trump's staying power. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told supporters that instead of going to South Carolina, he'll head home to \"take a deep breath\" and take stock of his struggling bid. Among Democrats, Sanders, who narrowly lost to Clinton in Iowa, appeals to liberal Democrats who believe President Barack Obama hasn't done enough to address the nation's wealth disparity. In her concession speech, Clinton echoed Sanders' calls for taking on Wall Street banks and tackling income inequality. But she cast herself as more prepared to make good on her pledges. \"People have every right to be angry. But they're also hungry, they're hungry for solutions,\" she said. Clinton's campaign argues she will perform better as the race heads to more racially diverse states, including Nevada and South Carolina. Both New Hampshire and Iowa are overwhelmingly white states that are far less diverse than the nation as a whole. Nevada has been considered Clinton territory, in part because of her strong relationships to the Latino community and longtime Democrats in the state. At stake Tuesday were less than 1 percent of the delegates who, at party national conventions in July, will choose nominees to succeed Obama. But a strong showing in New Hampshire can give a candidate momentum ahead of state contests in coming weeks, including the March 1 \"Super Tuesday\" when 11 states vote. Clinton remains ahead in the overall delegate count due to support from superdelegates \u2014 the party officials who can support the candidate of their choice at the convention. Overall, Clinton has amassed at least 392 delegates and Sanders at least 42; the magic number to clinch the nomination is 2,382. There were only 23 delegates at stake in New Hampshire's Republican primary, and they are awarded proportionally, based on the statewide vote. A candidate needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination.","label":0}

The false alarm was indicative of the high anxiety between the Koreas in the wake of the North's recent long-range rocket launch and nuclear test. North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency hours later hurled insults at South Korean President Park Geun-hye, calling her a \"tailless, old, insane bitch\" as it condemned her hard-line response to the North's recent actions. The government of Park, who has been a frequent target of sexist comments from the North, shut down a factory park in North Korea that had been jointly run by the rivals. Seoul also has started preparatory talks with Washington on deploying a sophisticated missile defense system in South Korea in attempts to tighten screws on Pyongyang. South Korea's front-line soldiers near the northwest island of Baengnyeong heard several explosions and also saw flashes from what the military believes were shells fired from North Korean coastal guns at around 7:20 a.m., said an official from Seoul's Defense Ministry, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. No North Korean projectile flew south of the maritime border, he said. An official from the county that governs the island said that residents didn't evacuate although fishing boats returned to their ports. She said that passenger vessels from the island and the mainland port of Incheon were operating normally. Meanwhile, Seoul's Defense Ministry said Saturday that the military completed its search operations for debris from the North Korean long-range rocket that was launched into orbit Feb. 7. The military said it was unlikely that there were any more crucial parts left to be found in South Korean seas. The ministry said that the navy recovered two pieces of debris presumed to be from the launch at an island off the country's western coast on Thursday and Friday. South Korean officials believe the North deliberately blew up the rocket's first stage after burnout to prevent South Korea from retrieving debris. North Korea said it launched an Earth observation satellite, but South Korea, the U.S. and the U.N. said it violated a ban on Pyongyang's missile technology.","label":0}

His programme includes a community imbizo at the Safa-Simba Stadium in Klipspruit on Saturday afternoon, where residents will discuss their concerns directly with him, Gauteng government spokeswoman Annette Griesel said on Tuesday. Mbeki's visit is part of the Gauteng Presidential Imbizo, an effort by government to meet local communities. Gauteng is the smallest province, but the second most densely populated after KwaZulu-Natal. Its economic hub, Johannesburg, continues to lure residents from across the country. According to the province the high levels of migration from within South Africa remained one of its key challenges. Other problems included high levels of crime, the impact of HIV\/Aids, upgrading the province's many sprawling informal settlements, and translating economic growth into employment growth  -- according to the province's Midterm Report 2004-2006. Mbeki's visit will include a stop at the infamous Europa Hotel in Hillbrow, once a haven for criminals and prostitutes now part of  the Better Buildings programme to clean up the inner city.  He will also visit the Gautrain Park Station portal. He will visit the Orlando Stadium in Soweto -- earmarked as a 2010 World Cup training facility -- and attend a June 16 veterans' ceremony in Diepkloof, Soweto. The president's meeting with the business sector through the Johannesburg Business Forum will include talks about the constraints to investment, transport and infrastructure. The imbizo will conclude with a closed meeting of the three spheres of government: local, provincial and national.

The last time the quarterly sales figure declined was a decade ago, in early  2003, according to the company. A monthly sales figure also fell for the first time in nearly a decade late last year. McDonald's Corp., based in Oak Brook, Ill., has been struggling to boost sales amid intensifying competition, changing eating habits and challenging economic conditions around the world. The company has responded by renewing its focus on value and rolling out new  menu items, such as chicken wraps, that are more in line with the fresher, healthier food people are increasingly searching for. For the quarter, McDonald's said global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 1 percent. That included a 1.2 percent drop in the U.S. where it  has been trying to boost sales by touting its Dollar Menu, a strategy that analysts warn could eat away at profit margins. Despite the drop, McDonald's said it increased its market share. The sales figure fell 1.1 percent in Europe, the company's biggest region by  sales. It fell 3.3 percent in the region encompassing Asia, the Middle East and  Africa, reflecting weakness in Japan and negative results in China. For the quarter, McDonald's Corp. earned $1.27 billion, or $1.26 per share. That compares with $1.266 billion, or $1.23 per share, a year ago. Revenue edged up 1 percent to $6.6 billion.

According to the central bank's preliminary report, the index of corporate goods prices stood at 99.8 against the 2010 base of 100, with the decline following a 3.2 percent drop logged a month earlier. As the global oil glut continues, with worldwide prices for crude continuing a largely downward trajectory, petroleum and coal-linked product prices took a hit, the bank said, with prices plummeting 21.8 percent on year, while prices of electric power, gas and water retreated 12.5 percent in the recording period. Other factors weighing on the index included prices for scrap and waste plunging almost 30 percent and those for nonferrous metals dropping 12.5 percent, the bank also said. The producer price index lost 0.2 percent from a month earlier, the BOJ added, while the export price index lost 0.2 percent on a contract currency basis. The import price index, meanwhile, lost 2.9 percent in the recording period from the previous month, the central bank's data revealed. A BOJ official stated Thursday that a decline in commodity prices and a comparatively firm yen had ensured import prices remained under pressure as well as impacting prices in the domestic economy. The official said however a turnaround could be on the cards, despite the yen's firmness, as both commodity and stock markets have been performing well, reflecting a risk-off mood among investors in local and neighboring markets. The BOJ also noted, however, that in yen terms export prices had slumped 7.9 percent in February, while import prices tumbled 17.8 percent in the recording period. Prices for food and beverages marked an uptick, however, increasing 0.9 percent and prices of pulp, paper-linked products also rose, gaining 0.8 percent, the BOJ said. Enditem","label":0}

The 42-year-old was denied bail in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court in May when Magistrate Grant Engel deemed him a flight risk. Defence lawyer William Booth brought an application for leave to appeal the bail ruling, and argued that the magistrate had erred in his findings as Novella had demonstrated his willingness to be placed under \"unique circumstances\". These included payment of R100,000 bail, reporting to the local police station, and being monitored by both a private security company and a tracking device. But Judge Le Grange was unconvinced that the magistrate was wrong in his findings. \"Moreover, the State's case, although circumstantial, points prima facie strongly to the guilt of the accused.\" Novella faces a charge of murder for allegedly killing his American marketing executive girlfriend Gabriela Kabrins Alban on July 28 last year. The couple had booked into a boutique hotel in Camps Bay on July 26, 2015. According to papers already before the court and statements provided to police, no person other than the couple stayed in the room, and no staff entered the room the night before Alban's body was discovered. It was only when staff enquired where Alban was that Novella reportedly answered she was dead. The police were called and Novella was immediately arrested. The crime scene was strewn with food and clothes. Police seized a substantial amount of foreign currency, iphones and tablets. A forensic pathologist found that Alban had been strangled and also showed signs of blunt head injury. Novella was subsequently examined by a forensic psychiatrist hired by his legal team, who found him fit to stand trial. In Wednesday's judgement, Le Grange detailed Novella's wealth and \"somewhat unstable\" lifestyle. Born to a billionaire family, he was raised in Guatemala where his family controls a group of companies that focus on the production of construction materials. It is also the main provider of cement in Central America. He also receives a monthly payment of 10,000 US dollars per month and has never been employed for more than two or three years at a particular company. The judgement further detailed his drug dependence which started at the age of 21, and was used as \"part of his spiritual needs\" and pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. Before the murder, Novella booked into a retreat in Magaliesburg for a week in May \"to undergo spiritual treatment\". There, he took a natural psychoactive substance called Ibogaine to help with his addiction difficulties. Le Grange found that the magistrate had been correct in his findings which concluded that Novella could easily afford to forfeit his bail, has the means to hide anywhere in the world, has no formal employment and has no immediate family roots. There was also no extradition treaty between South Africa and Guatemala. \"The magistrate gave a well-reasoned and detailed judgement. The criticism that the magistrate's decision was wrong within the meaning of section 65(4) and that it will be in the interest of justice to permit the release of the Appellant on bail, is in my view without merit.\" Le Grange also said that the fact that most of the security guarantees would be financed by Novella or his family created a \"sense of unease\" and could be open to manipulation. He also found that the confiscation of Novella's passports, Italian and Guatemalan, was of \"cold comfort\" as documents could easily be obtained to leave the country. Novella's lawyer has indicated they will argue diminished capacity due to drug intoxication when the case goes to trial. In the meantime, he will remain at Pollsmoor prison until a pre-trial hearing at the Western Cape High Court scheduled for October 28. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The audit should focus particularly on the process leading to the involvement of jailed businessman Schabir Shaik and his company, Prodiba, DA spokesman Stuart Farrow said in a statement on  Monday. The credit card-type licence system had been surrounded by controversy since its inception, with the latest scandal being the bribes allegedly paid to former transport minister Mac Maharaj and his wife Zarina by Shaik's companies to have the licence tender awarded to Prodiba. \"While it is important to get to the bottom of the bribery allegations, it is even more important to ensure that South Africa has a secure and rigid licensing system in place to prevent improperly-trained drivers from exacerbating the carnage on our roads,\" Farrow said. The performance audit should, among other things, provide a full  account of all funds spent on implementing the new licence system and production of licences, and investigate whether all tender and accounting procedures were adhered to. It should also establish the comparative advantages and drawbacks of the credit card-type licence system over the previous ID-book driver's licence system, and whether the time spent and the  expense incurred by millions of South Africans in obtaining and renewing the licences were justified. \"With respect to the former transport minister, should there be confirmation that the credit card-type licence system was indeed beyond reproach, it would certainly strengthen any evidence that Mr  Maharaj could offer to refute the allegations against him,\" Farrow said.

The March production growth from factories, mines and utilities beat financial market forecasts of a two percent rise and was up from a slim 0.5 percent increase in February. While output expansion is still far below double-digit rates in previous years when Asia's third-largest economy was booming, \"it's getting better slowly\", said Credit Suisse economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde. Three interest rate cuts since the start of 2013 should start feeding through to bolster consumer demand, analysts said, while export growth is improving with a sharply weaker rupee buttressing overseas sales. The output figures are \"generally in line with our view of a gradual uptick in activity\", said Goldman Sachs economist Tushar Poddar. The Congress-led government, buffeted by a string of corruption scandals, is  desperate for signs of better growth before facing voters in general elections due in the first half of 2014. The economy has been struggling under the weight of high interest rates in the face of uncomfortably strong inflation and sluggish investment amid fears about graft and disappointment with the slow pace of government economic reforms. Manufacturing, which accounts for three-quarters of the Index of Industrial Production, grew by 3.2 percent in March. Capital goods output of machinery and other products, seen as a key sign of investment intentions, grew by 6.9 percent and for the first time since mid-2011, posted back-to-back monthly rises. \"A recovery in capital spending is already under way and should slowly gather steam through the current fiscal year,\" said Prior-Wandesforde. Output of so-called consumer non-durables like food grew by 6.5 percent in March, the second strongest number since January 2012. But production of consumer durables, such as washing machines, fridges and furniture, stayed in the doldrums, falling by 4.5 percent, coinciding with the longest stretch of car sales weakness since records started being kept in 1997. Car sales slid by 10.43 percent last month from a year ago, according to separate industry figures, as still high borrowing costs and consumer unease about the economy put the brakes on discretionary spending. The government forecasts the economy will grow by at least six percent in this financial year, which began April 1, after estimated expansion of five percent last year -- its slowest rate in a decade. Industrial output will remain reasonably tepid, experts say, partly due to bottlenecks caused by dilapidated highways, ports, power shortages and other infrastructure problems which dampen growth. The government must make improving infrastructure, expanding fuel supplies and clearing long-delayed industrial projects a \"priority\", said Naina Lal Kidwai, head of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Business leaders were particularly alarmed by a grim energy situation. Manufacturing output \"is constrained by shortage of power. Electricity growth has decelerated to just half of what it was in 2011-12\", Kidwai said. Sapa-AFP \/th","label":0}

Macedonian security forces on Monday said in the north border of the country, several tens of migrants tried to cross from Macedonia to Serbia and continue their journey up north. \"Once the legal registration process is no longer available, it is logical to expect black migrant routes to return. The countries in the region will have to increase the efforts to control illegal transits,\" security expert Blagoja Markovski said. In the past day, not a single permit for transition of a migrant was issued in Macedonia, the Macedonian Ministry of Interior reported. As a comparison, since the beginning of the year almost 90,000 permits were issued, and half of them (44,734) were for citizens of Syria. Several thousand migrants still remain stuck along the so-called Balkan route. Almost 1,500 of them are on Macedonian territory in refugee camp Tabanovce on the border with Serbia. \"Almost 400 migrants left the camp and crossed over the border to no-man's land in an attempt to pressure authorities into opening the border. They say they will stay there until March 17 when the EU has to adopt a final decision for the future of the Balkan migrant route,\" a volunteer in a humanitarian NGO working in the camp told Xinhua. The cold and rainy weather is making the refugees' stay out in the open unbearable. Most of them, including babies, are suffering colds and influenza. \"Our biggest problem is the closing of the borders. We don't have a Plan B. We are stuck here for days. The only thing that is important to us is to cross the border and reach Germany as a real safe country. Our family wants to escape from the war. We are ready to die here but we won't go back,\" a Syrian migrant in Tabanovce said. In the Greek refugee camp Idomeni, almost 15,000 migrants are waiting to be allowed to enter Macedonia from Greece. Last Saturday, the children from the camp blocked the railways, demanding the borders be opened. Local media reported that around 400 migrants, tired of waiting, left the camp in Idomeni on Monday to try and walk around the security fence and cross the border to Macedonia. Migrants often risk their lives when crossing borders. They walk on foot on unprotected railway lines, risk being mugged and try to swim rivers swollen from heavy rains. Three migrants, two men and a woman, drowned in the waters of Suva Reka river near the Macedonian town Gevgelija on Monday. According to information from the Macedonian Ministry of Interior, they were part of a bigger migrant group that was trying to transit through the country. The surviving 23 migrants from the group were taken to the transition camp near Gevgelija where they received first health aid. Enditem","label":1}

Turning a deaf ear to China's calls for honoring its promise not to take sides on the maritime disputes, the U.S. has since last October sent warships and military jets to deliberately violate China's territorial waters in the South China Sea. At the press conference, Kerry said that the United States has the so-called \"freedom-of-navigation\" right in the South China Sea. \"In fact, there has never been such a problem with freedom of navigation in the South China Sea,\" Wang stressed. \"The situation in the South China Sea is overall stable.\" As for militarization in the South China Sea, Wang said that people always focused on China's moves, but turned a blind eye to the advanced military equipments deployed by some other country in the South China Sea, including missel destroyers and strategic bombers. During the past decades, some countries illegally occupied China's islands and militarized them heavily, not only with radars, but also with all kinds of artillery, he said. \"The demilitarization needs efforts of all parties, not only China, but also the United States and ASEAN countries,\" Wang said.

Voters are choosing a president from a list of 30 candidates to replace transitional leader Catherine Samba-Panza, who was put in place in January 2014. More than 1.8 million people are expected to vote at more than 500 polling stations nationwide. Central African Republic has been rocked by unrest since March 2013 when a largely Muslim alliance of rebel groups overthrew President Francois Bozize. The rebel leader left power in 2014 and a horrific backlash by the Christian anti-Balaka militia against Muslim civilians followed. Sectarian violence has continued, displacing nearly 1 million people. That elections are being held at all and right on deadline is seen as a minor miracle. Still, there were a few problems, with some names of candidates for parliament reported missing from ballots. But, at least through mid-day, there were no reports of violence. Samba-Panza voted at a school in the capital, Bangui, urging others to get to the polls. \"Many thought this day, this vote would not be possible for security and organizational reasons. But, you see, we all are voting in dignity and peace and I am proud,\" she said. Among the favored candidates are former prime ministers Martin Ziguele and Anicet Georges Dologuele, and Abdoul Karim Meckassoua, a former foreign minister under former President Bozize. People of Central African Republic are also voting for a National Assembly. Worries about the vote materialized for Christian Guenebeme, who said he was a legislative candidate but couldn't find his name on the ballots. \"I'm disappointed that neither my name nor my picture appear on the ballot for legislative candidates in two voting centers. We were right to say that the conditions were not yet ripe for organizing these elections,\" he said. Marcellin Daza, 42, said that people's names are missing and there is disorder, but he wants change. \"We are discouraged, but we cannot give up the vote out of love for our country. It's time for things to change,\" Daza said. Refugees also gathered in Cameroon's border town Garoua Boulai Wednesday, where 12,000 have registered to vote, hoping for peace to return so they can go back home to Central African Republic. U.N. peacekeepers, police, armed forces and gendarmerie have been deployed. Five people died in violence in a vote on a referendum on Dec. 13 that was seen as a test for these national elections. ___ Associated Press reporter Joel Kouam in Garoua Boulai, Cameroon contributed to this report.","label":1}

Since then, Equal Education\u2019s Norms and Standards campaign has entered a second phase. This second phase involves activism and monitoring around the demand that the Norms and Standards for School Infrastructure are fully implemented. EE has named this part of our campaign in honour of the late Michael Komape, a primary school learner who died after falling into a dilapidated pit latrine at his school in Limpopo. Through regular schools visits, mass meetings, engagement with the Province, and other organising work, the new Eastern Cape office of Equal Education is leading the Michael Komape campaign.  2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Youth Work, Community Organising and Campaigns in King William\u2019s Town and other Areas.

A study released Tuesday concludes that teenagers who see friends smoking and drinking alcohol in photographs posted on Facebook and Myspace are more likely to smoke and drink themselves. \"Our study shows that adolescents can be influenced by their friends' online  pictures to smoke or drink alcohol,\" said Thomas Valente of the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine and the study's principal investigator. \"To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply social network analysis methods to examine how teenagers' activities on online social networking sites influence their smoking and alcohol use.\" Valente and his team drew conclusions from a survey of 1,563 students from the El Monte Union High School District in Los Angeles County in October 2010 and April 2011. The researchers found that the size of one's online network of friends was not a major factor associated with risky behavior but that exposure to friends'  online pictures of partying or drinking was linked to smoking and alcohol use. Teens whose close friends did not drink alcohol were more likely to be affected by increasing exposure to risky online pictures. \"The evidence suggests that friends' online behaviors are a viable source of  peer influence,\" said Grace Huang, one of the researchers. \"This is important to know, given that 95 percent of 12 to 17 year olds in the United States access the Internet every day, and 80 percent of those youth use online social networking sites to communicate.\" Students who responded to the survey were evenly distributed across gender and on average 15 years old.

The SAB League is the fourth tier of South African football and the second highest tier controlled by the SA Football Association (SAFA). This particular league has an impressive 1 000 plus teams and includes close to 30 000 players. At the heart of the success of the SAB League lies the special relationship between SAFA and sponsor. SAB's commitment to grassroots development with the aim of creating future stars of the game, is both commendable as well as praiseworthy. SAB's long-lasting relationship and love affair with SA football stretches as far back as the 1950s right up until current times with its loyal sponsorship of the senior national team Bafana Bafana. Further to this is a broader goal of both SAB and SAFA to drive socio-economic change in poorer communities via sport and an inherent desire to inspire young footballers to improve their overall livelihoods. SAB aim to alleviate poverty, prevent underage drinking and run annual life skills workshops. The proof is there as it is this way of thinking that has brought positive change to many footballers lives and delivered to them untold success. This approach has also thus provided great benefits for South African football as a whole as well. This has all been achieved with the sole aim of identifying and nurturing young football talent from a tender age, all the way up to the highest levels. This ultimately provides a solid springboard for players who indeed have the necessary skills and tools to succeed. Evidence lies in the fact that many players who have plied their trade in the SAB League have then gone on to participate in the lucrative Premier Soccer League (PSL), one of the biggest and richest leagues on the continent. These very same players have then gone onto representing their national team as well as be scouted by top international clubs. Popular SAB League alumni include Andile Jali, Themba Zwane and Reneilwe Letsholonyane among others. Jele has previously attributed his success to the SAB League itself by stating: \"I am one of many South African players who were scouted from the SAB League. \"I still reminisce with some of my current peers in the Premier Soccer League of our days in the SAB League and how it has contributed to us perfecting our basic football abilities at an early age\". Bafana assistant coach Thabo Senong is a another example of being a product of the SAB League as the youngest-ever coach to be part of the senior national team. The league has also been known to constantly offer clinics and official licensed courses to 'upskill' coaches. SAB's ambassadors over the years also include John 'Shoes' Moshoeu who conducted coaching clinics and imparted valuable skills to youth, which went a long way to inspiring and motivating them. The League's holistic approach to development is in line with SAFA's 2022 vision of having a sufficient number of qualified coaches and players in the country and all-in-all, this particular league provides a steady grounding for players, coaching staff and match-officials that ensure sustainability in the long run. The ABC Motsepe League, sponsored Patrice Motsepe, is the current second division and overall third tier of South African football which features close to 150 teams. Doing well here means teams will be a step away from the Premier League and this in itself is a huge motivation for players, teams, coaches as well as match officials and administrators who wish to impress. This particular league matches the SAB League in terms of high-end sponsorship and is backed by the Motsepe foundation. The foundation, like SAB, aims to drive amateur football and ensure necessary growth. They provide youngsters with the opportunity to impress and enter a professional league. The league is named after the late ABC Motsepe senior in what is an apt nod to the legacy of a man who was a school principal and committed to the growth and development of youth. This also links nicely to another sponsored initiative, the Kay Motsepe Schools Cup which also strives to provide opportunities for disadvantaged youth. Numerous players from this league have graduated up to the National First Division (NFD), Premier League and further up to the main national team as well as globally. Scouts are always present at ABC League games and playoffs with the aim of unearthing talent for various national teams. Added to this, the league itself is very lucrative. The overall winners of the competition each season receive prize money of R1-million (R800 00 will go to the club, with the other R200 000 to aid youth development), while the runners-up get R500 000. Overall, both leagues seem to be fantastic stepping-stones to greater success. A superb example of success via these leagues is Chippa United FC. This club climbed up the ranks through both leagues all the way up to the Premier League where they have punched above their weight. In 2016 they finished sixth and also gained a semifinal spot in the MTN 8. SAFA, in conjunction with SAB and the Motsepe Foundation, is 100 percent committed to sustaining as well as enhancing and improving both leagues for many decades to come. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The party had originally said it would march to the ANC's headquarters, Luthuli House, in the Johannesburg CBD but this plan was thwarted by metro police. The party would instead march to Beyers Naude Square, a block away from Luthuli House. The DA has said it will be a peaceful march. Khoza said the ANC did not believe the DA would end their much at Bayers Naude Square. \"Their intention is to come to Luthuli House,\" he said. Khoza said the ANC was busy with court proceedings. The DA's Gauteng leader John Moodey rubbished the claims and accused the ANC  of grasping at straws. \"They are desperate because they know they can't keep control of their members. We are a disciplined organisation and comply with the law,\" he said. \"They are the ones who come with militant behaviour by sending out the MK Umkhonto we Sizwe with military uniform and intimidate people.\" The ANC's Jackson Mthembu said in a statement that the move was necessitated  by information at their disposal of the DA contracting private security guards who would be armed to be part of the march. \"In addition they have booked a hospital, procured helmets and shields, and organised emergency services to be on standby.\" He said it was clear that the DA had no intention of conducting a peaceful event. Mthembu said the application was to ensure that there was no potential for incidents of intimidation and provocation. When the DA first announced its intention to march, Mthembu warned the party  not to provoke the ANC. He warned the DA about what happened when it marched to the Congress of SA Trade Unions' office two years ago. Cosatu members clashed with DA supporters as they made their way to the lawns of the Joburg (formerly the Civic) Theatre, 50 metres from the trade union federation's office. Stones were thrown and a number of people were left injured. Riot police were alerted and teargas and water cannon were used. Mthembu said the ANC did not want to be put in the same situation and called  on the DA to reconsider the march. Mthembu on Tuesday claimed the march was part of the DA's \"desperate and high-risk stunts\" in order to capture the political limelight. \"However this time the risks they are taking places ordinary people in danger.  \"When they march with weapons and hired gunmen, they are taking us back to an era when violence and conflict defined our political environment,\" he said.

Pierre Moscovici said Panama was listed by the EU as a whole \u2014 and separately by 8 of the bloc's 28 nations \u2014 as a non-compliant state on tax affairs. He said that the media revelations linking the central American nation to massive tax fraud were \"frankly shocking.\" Moscovici said Thursday: \"Let's call a spade a spade: non-cooperative jurisdictions are tax havens.\" He added that \"we have to list them through a common EU blacklist and to be ready to hit them with appropriate sanctions if they refuse to change.\" ___ 1:55 p.m. A member of Dutch bank ABN Amro's supervisory board says he is stepping down with immediate effect after his name appeared in the huge leak of information on offshore companies known as the Panama Papers. ABN Amro announced the departure of Bert Meerstadt in a brief statement Thursday that made no mention of his reported links to an offshore corporation established in the British Virgin Islands by Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which helps create shell companies for the world's rich and famous. The Dutch bank then issued a personal statement from Meerstadt in which he says he already was in the process of leaving ABN Amro, but was now stepping down immediately, \"to prevent any detrimental effects to the bank\" after two Dutch newspapers linked him to the company on the British Virgin Islands. In the statement, Meerstadt says he will not comment on the report in the Financieel Dagblad newspaper, which said that he was listed in March 2001 as a shareholder in a company called Morclan Corporation. Two weeks later, the shares in his name were transferred to a trust office on Guernsey. ___ 1:05 p.m. The chief executive of Austrian lender Hypo Landesbank Vorarlberg has resigned after the bank was mentioned in reports about offshore companies. The bank said Thursday that Michael Grahammer \"surprisingly declared his resignation last night.\" Austrian public broadcaster ORF reported this week that at least 20 offshore companies had accounts with Hypo Vorarlberg, including one attributed to Gennady Timchenko, a Russian billionaire with longtime personal ties to President Vladimir Putin. ORF is one of dozens of media outlets worldwide that had access to the so-called Panama Papers, a trove of documents detailing offshore companies of the rich and famous. Grahammer said in a statement that \"media prejudgment\" prompted him to resign, but that both he and the bank had acted according within the law. ___ 12:10 p.m. Anti-fraud activists are blocking entrances at the Paris headquarters of French bank Societe Generale to protest its alleged involvement in creating offshore accounts, as detailed in the so-called \"Panama Papers\" reports.

Abbott is due to give a prepared speech to conservative, far-right group Alliance Defending Freedom in New York on Friday (Australian time), but the Australian media has published an advance copy of his address. The former prime minister, replaced by Malcolm Turnbull in September last year after an inner-party revolt, said Australia - and other places yet to legislate same-sex marriage - should not hastily change the fundamental nature of marriage without mapping out any possible impact on society. \"We shouldn't try to change something without understanding it, without grasping why it is that one man and one woman open to children until just a very few years ago has always been considered the essence of marriage and the heart of family,\" Abbott said in his speech, quoted by The Australian newspaper on Friday. \"We can't shirk our responsibilities to the future, but let's also respect and appreciate values and institutions that have stood the test of time and pass them on, undamaged, when that's best. That's a goal we should all be able to share.\" Despite having a sister who is in an openly homosexual relationship with another woman, Abbott would draw on his own family to reaffirm his stance that the definition of marriage should remain between a man and a woman. \"These days, at least in Western countries, family structures are typically more complex than they used to be,\" Abbott said. \"Two of my sisters are divorced. One has a new partner. Another has a same-sex partner. To me, my sisters' partners are first-class members of our extended family. \"In today's world, we need less ideology and more common sense; we need less impatience and more respect; we need less shouting at people and more engagement with them.\" Currently, same-sex marriage is allowed in all 50 American states after the Supreme Court in June last year ruled that marriage equality was protected in their constitution. Australia is yet to legalize gay marriage, but Prime Minister Turnbull has pledged a plebiscite on the issue in 2017. Abbott urged those in politics, and the broader public, to first consider the repercussions of changing marriage, saying they could be catastrophic for everyday families. \"Policymakers shouldn't be judgmental about people's personal choices but we can't be indifferent to the erosion of family given its consequences for the wider community,\" Abbott said. \"It was my distinguished predecessor (Liberal Party PM) John Howard who pointed out that the traditional family was the best social welfare system that mankind has ever devised.\" Last week Abbott revealed he would recontest his local seat at the next election, joining Labor's Kevin Rudd, as the only former prime minister to seek another term following demotion from Australia's top job.

It was the Eastern Cape side who drew first blood, when midfielder Rhuzani Manzini produced a right footed finish in the 17th minute to record his fifth goal of the season. The visitors seemed to create the better scoring chances in the first half, but were unable to increase their advantage going into the halftime break. For Stars, the best chance in the first half fell to midfielder Sibusiso Msomi, but his powerful shot was pushed wide by Chippa goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi in the 25th minute. Stars seemed to be the more attacking side in the second half, and Malawian midfielder Robert Ng'ambi levelled matters in the 57th minute when he scored with a right footed effort from a cross by Siyabonga Zulu. This was Ng'ambi's fifth goal of the season for the Rustenburg-based outfit. With the match heading towards a stalemate finish, Ndumiso Mabena produced a well-timed cross which Stars' Nambian striker Benson Shilongo managed to latch on to in referees' optional time, to allow the hosts to collect all three points. Mabena, who came on as a second half substitute on the hour mark for the experienced Henrico Botes, proved to be quite a handful for the visitors, with his crosses creating several attacking opportunities. Stars coach Cavin Johnson will be over the moon with the important home win, but will not be happy in another area where his side won as well. The North West Province side won the yellow card count 3-2, with Sibusiso Msomi, Sphamandla Sililo and Willem Mwedihanga finding their way into the match official's book for yellow card offences. For Chippa, Kristopher Bergman and Phetolo Sekome were booked. Stars, with only one loss (a 2-1 reverse to Mamelodi Sundowns) in their last eight league outings of which three have been won, now have 22 points from 19 matches and will begin preparations to host Golden Arrows in their next league encounter on Tuesday.

Last month, Namibia started public consultations on the New Equitable Economic Empowerment Bill, which would also require all white-owned businesses to cede at least 50% of management positions to PDPs. The bill also prohibits white males from selling such ownership to their white wives, regardless of whether they are PDPs or not. Further, the bill also prohibits PDP beneficiaries from selling any portion of their businesses to white males. It also calls for the establishment of a council consisting of selected Cabinet members and six other persons to preside over the selection of companies, the sales and transfer of shares. The council would be empowered to seize documents and equipment from companies in cases where improper conduct would be alleged. In addition, the council would be empowered to close all businesses deemed to have failed to comply with the law. Top Namibian investment risk analyst and consultant Eben De Klerk told the \"Namibian Sun\" that many white business people were considering leaving the country for friendlier investment destinations. He said legal consultations had revealed low prospects of success if the businesses community challenged the constitutionality of the bill in court. \"We were advised that although a court challenge is possible, it is more likely that the court will respond with a sort to a fall-back argument to the effect that the bill is still in draft format, which means that the court cannot make an order at this consultative stage,\" he said. The legal consultants also warned that although the Namibian Companies Act provided several safeguard against expropriation, that was no guarantee of security as government could amend and re-align it with the new empowerment law. De Klerk said if approved, the bill would cripple the Namibian economy. He said businesses preferred Mauritius because they found its flat taxation, high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and corruption-free business environment more attractive when compared to the \"non-enabling\" legal, political and economic environment in Namibia. However, the Office of Namibian Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has defended the bill, saying it does not contravene the constitution. Further, Permanent Secretary in the PM's office, Andrew Ndishishi, said there was nothing alarming with the bill as many other countries had successfully implemented similar empowerment laws. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}
{"id":"5db56b79ee1f200017463ab0","url":"SAP20100824634.txt","text":"by Arthur MacMillan Iraq's privately-owned banks have called for the country's state-owned lenders to be privatised to break up a near monopoly in  lending by politicians whose actions remain stuck in the Saddam-era. Although foreign cash has flowed in since the US-led invasion of  2003, ministers still opt to use government banks to do business and are failing to use private rivals, which is hampering economic growth, bankers argue. The lack of a new government and poor security are also stifling  efforts among international banks to plant a solid foothold in Iraq, whose economy, with the exception of oil, is showing little sign of improvement despite low inflation and a stable currency. Fouad al-Hassani, chairman of the Iraqi Private Banking League, said the next government should privatise the seven state-backed lenders to create a level playing field among banks, as promised under the constitution. \"Unless they are privatised the government will still lean on their own banks,\" he said. \"That is not in line with an open market  policy. \"We are looking for a new government so that we can talk to them  again. The constitution is very clear on what they should do.\" Iraq currently has 36 privately-owned banks, most of them each holding capital of 50-150 million dollars, compared to 17 private banks during the rule of dictator Saddam Hussein, ousted in the invasion. Six of today's private banks have foreign shareholders -- banned  before 2003 -- with global giant HSBC and the National Bank of Kuwait holding majority stakes in Iraqi lenders. Banks from Iran, Turkey, Lebanon and Bahrain are also investing in Iraq but business remains dominated by government lenders, just as it was under Saddam. \"We are now handling about 15 percent of the country's total liquidity, compared to less than five percent in 2003,\" with the state banks controlling the rest, said Hassani, who is aiming for a  25-percent stake within two years. \"Because the government owns virtually everything, 95 percent of  business is done by the government, be it in defence, health, industry or whatever,\" added Hassani, who is also managing director  of privately-owned Credit Bank of Iraq. \"If they let go, they will benefit\" as a result of free market competition, he added. A continuing lack of security in Iraq -- 535 people were killed in July, the deadliest month since May 2008 -- and no new government since an inconclusive March 7 general election are also deterring investment. \"It is difficult for a foreigner to come into a situation like this. Why should they be killed for a five-percent profit?\" Hassani, 72, asked. A survey of more than 300 senior executives by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) published on Monday found that seven years after the invasion, 64 percent thought it was still too dangerous to do business in Iraq. Dr Sinan Al-Shibibi, governor of the Iraq Central Bank, conceded  that many international banks are put off by the violence. \"The prospects are good, except for security,\" he said. \"Some kind of cooperation with foreign banks will definitely be there I have no doubt. \"We are calling for them to come and help develop the financial system, this is the objective. I would prefer that they establish standalone branches but even if they do a partnership with Iraqi banks that would be fine.\" The Iraqi dinar was revalued after the invasion and it has been stable at 1,160-1,180 to the dollar for almost two years, helping deliver stable inflation of around three percent. Typical interest is about six percent on dinar deposits and loan  rates tend to vary between eight and 12 percent, but trust is still  low among the public. \"We are still a cash society but it is developing and improving slowly,\" Shibibi said, asked why Iraqis are often reluctant to bank  their money. Indrajit Roy Choudhury, an Indian banking expert working for the  state-owned Trade Bank of Iraq, said Hassani was right about a historic lack of government use of private banks, but argued that the situation was steadily changing. \"Slowly it's being done. Government ministries are now contracting out to businesses and using letters of credit, which is  creating business for private banks. Previously all trade would have been done internally,\" he said. Sapa-AFP \/pc","label":0}

Rwanda also sponsored a DRC rebel group opposed to Kinshasa, which harboured and supported the Rwandan Hutu forces.

However, all projected costs are subject to the economy growing at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. We are nowhere near this type of economic growth in South Africa,\" he said. Current economic growth was \"erratically jumping between the 0.7 percent and 1.3 percent mark for the 2015\/2016 financial year\". This meant that, in effect, the state's calculations for financing the NHI amounted to \"nothing more than speculation on the best-case scenario, when in fact we find ourselves in the worst-case scenario\". \"The reality facing us all is that the projected R256 billion required to finance the NHI over the next 14 years will in fact not be enough, leaving the debate open as to who will contribute to finance the shortfall when the NHI has come into full effect. The short answer is, inevitably, the taxpayer,\" Greyling said. AfriBusiness would monitor the situation regarding NHI financing and would do everything possible to ensure that taxpayers would not be blindsided as a result of poor planning and unachievable aspirations by the state. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Before almost 10,000 investors, Daniela Bergdolt, from the DSW group  of small investors, judged that \"the reputation built by Siemens for 160 years has been reduced to ashes.\" Albrecht Kinkelin, a 64-year-old investor from Munich, told AFP however that \"corruption in the economy is not exceptional,\" and estimated that \"the group's image is certainly damaged, but not forever.\" All the same, he felt Siemens ought to have \"acted more frankly.\" The sprawling industrial group has been battling for more than a year since successive revelations of corruption began to tarnish its hard-won image. \"It is not satisfactory that the affair has not been wrapped up after more than a year,\" complained Hans Hirt, who represented the British pension fund Hermes. Siemens has uncovered at least 1.3 billion euros (1.9 billion dollars) in dubious transactions in its accounts, mostly undisclosed payments to obtain international contracts. The group is under investigation in several countries, has lost its boss and spent 1.6 billion euros already in the form of fines and fees for an internal probe. That figure could explode if Siemens is hit by sanctions from the US  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The German group lists shares in the United States, and might have to pay up to four billion euros there, according to some German press reports. Talks with US authorities, from the SEC and the Department of Justice, are to begin next month and last several months for a \"case without precedent,\" in the terms of Siemens supervisory board president  Gerhard Cromme. Cromme is now facing sharp criticism from shareholders, along with his right-hand man, Deutsche Bank chairman Josef Ackermann. \"Sirs, we must really begin from scratch, and I will not vote to renew your mandate,\" said Bergdolt of the DSW association. But the family of company founder Werner von Siemens, which holds six percent of the company's equity, has taken the rare step of issuing  a statement in support of Siemens' managment and supervisors. Meanwhile, the investment fund DWS congratulated the supervisory board for the \"new start\" represented by its nomination seven months ago of Peter Loescher as chief executive. He is the first Siemen's boss to be recruited from outside the company. Loescher has shaken up the management board, launched a hunt for staff tainted by corruption, and simplified the structure of a group present in 190 countries that turns out products from lightbulbs to trains and electric power stations. Above all, he presented brilliant quarterly results. Net profit in the first quarter of the group's 2007-2008 fiscal year, which began on October 1, leapt from 788 million euros to 6.5 billion owing to the sale of an automotive parts division, VDO. Order books are full as well, and Loescher said he was not worried by a possible recession in the United States, where Siemens is the biggest German company by sales. For investors there was good news in the form of a share buyback plan worth two billion euros in the next few months. For now, \"alleged corruption and proven misconduct,\" in the words of  Cromme, have not hurt the company's finances. That could change however if the SEC slaps Siemens with heavy fines or excludes it from US public tenders. Or if, as the pragmatic analyst Frank Rothauge of Sal Oppenheim noted on the news magazine Spiegel's website, the group's new ethical standards prevent it from obtaining contracts.

{"id":"5db56b78ee1f2000174639b3","url":"SAPAI-4c095706fa-12438.txt","text":"Four generations of farming in Hilde Wiese's family are about to  come to an end in Namibia following a government order to sell their farm. Wiese is among 15 white farm owners who were told by Lands Minister Hifikepunye Pohamba to \"make an offer\" within 14 days to sell their property and enter into negotiations on the expropriation. The deadline expires on Monday. Wiese, 68, owns Ongombo West, a farm located some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Windhoek where she and her son Andreas raise cattle, grow vegetables and for the past five years, produce arum lilies for export to Germany and The Netherlands. But a dispute with six black labourers who were evicted from the  farm put Wiese in the eye of a political storm over land ownership in Namibia, a former German colony that was later ruled by apartheid South Africa until independence in 1990. \"We have to sell the farm to the government, what else can we do?\" Andreas, 30, told AFP. President Sam Nujoma singled out the Wiese farm in a speech at a  May Day rally, saying that \"some of the whites are behaving as if they came from Holland or Germany\" for evicting their workers. \"Steps will be taken and we can drive them out of this land. We have the capacity to do so,\" Nujoma said. The president's tirade was the last straw for the Wieses who feel they are scapegoats in a political campaign that is heating up  ahead of elections in Namibia in November and Nujoma's upcoming retirement.  \"President Nujoma mentioned me by name and called me a 'criminal' in connection with the eviction of farm labourers. Our case is being used to set a precedent\", said Andreas. Namibia's mainly-white Agricultural Union has asked the government to extend the 14-day deadline, complaining that the criteria for choosing the 15 were unclear.  The order to the white farmers to sell their property has raised  fears that Namibia may be on the same path as Zimbabwe, where land from white farmers was seized, some forcibly, and given to landless  blacks.  But the Namibian government maintains that land reform will be carried out within the context of the law and that the measure is necessary to address the fact that most of Namibia's arable land is  in white hands. Two years ago, members of Nujoma's governing SWAPO party marched  on a farm near the eastern town of Gobabis, broke the locks on the gate and slashed the tyres of tractors while shouting anti-white slogans after the farmer won a court order to evict his labourers. The Wiese family had a similar eviction order in hand when six black workers, their wives and 10 children, were removed from their  farm a few days before Christmas last year. The Wieses wanted the six to leave after a dispute over a goose that was accidently killed by one of the workers turned nasty and Andreas was threatened by a labourer with a knife. \"The whole issue is political. We went from door to door at the labour ministry to have the dispute solved but the six and their union representatives never pitched up for arbitration appointments,\" said Andreas. A labour court in February ordered that the workers be re-instated and the six are back at work but they are refusing to move back into their humble houses on the farm. \"We don't know that we can go and live there again\", says Amanda  Hoebes who lives in a tent provided by the Namibian government near  a river not far from the farm. \"We heard of the eviction and we hope we can settle on the farm once the owners are gone\", Hoebes told AFP. She said that the government has been providing them with fresh water deliveries once a week and also some food. At the Wiese family, work is already winding down in anticipation of the sale. A popular campsite for tourists on the farmstead is closed and no lilies have been planted in recent months. \"Our future is too uncertain now,\" says Andreas, who declined to  discuss the terms of their offer to sell to the government. His mother plans to retire in Windhoek and Andreas said he will do \"anything else except agriculture.\" \"My grandfather came to then South West Africa in 1896 and boug","label":1}

The offence means that Kyrgios receives an additional fine of US$ 25,000, and is suspended from ATP tournaments for eight tournament weeks, effective from today, Monday 17 October, 2016, through to Sunday 15 January, 2017. However, the suspension will be reduced to three tournament weeks upon agreement that the player enters a plan of care under the direction of a Sports Psychologist, or an equivalent plan approved by ATP, meaning Kyrgios could regain eligibility to compete on the ATP World Tour or Challenger Tour from Monday 7 November, 2016. Kyrgios had already been fined a total of US$ 16,500 for breaches of the ATP Code of Conduct by the ATP Supervisors on-site in Shanghai.

All are Muslims and had their homes bombed. The children's ages ranged between two and 17. Two families come from the capital Damascus and one from Deir Azzor province, which is controlled by Islamic State militants, the Vatican said. On the return flight, Francis said his move was suggested by an aide last week, and was not an implicit criticism of the recent migrant-swap deal between the European Union and Turkey. \"There is no political speculation behind it,\" he said. Citing Mother Teresa, the pope said his act of generosity was \"a drop in the sea, but after this drop the sea will not be the same.\" He also said he understood public fears about migration and urged Europe to focus on integration, jobs and growth. Humanitarian groups are outraged about the EU-Turkey deal, as it seriously restricts the right of newly arrived migrants to Greece to apply for asylum. Instead, they are to be returned to Turkey - and from there, only Syrians are given a chance to be relocated to the EU. In Lesbos, Francis visited the Moria facility, one of the controversial \"hotspot\" centres financed by the EU, which separates migrants with asylum rights from others who are to be repatriated, and is considered a prison by human rights activists. \"Today I wanted to be with you. I want to tell you that you are not alone,\" the pope told migrants. Accompanied by two senior Orhodox church leaders, Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople and Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Ieronymos, Francis greeted individually hundreds of people inside Moria. The three men were confronted with children, elderly people in wheelchairs and women in tears; one knelt and wailed before the pope. Before they made their speeches, a chant of \"freedom, freedom,\" rang in the air. The religious leaders signed a joint declaration calling for greater international efforts to solve the migration crisis, peace in the Middle East, and pledging greater efforts to heal the centuries-old division between the Orthodox and Catholic churches. The pontiff is an outspoken champion of the destitute. Flying out to Lesbos, he compared the plight of migrants around the world to \"the biggest humanitarian catastrophe after World War II\" and said he was embarking on a \"sad journey.\" After sitting down for lunch with some 250 asylum seekers at the Moria camp, Francis, Bartholomew and Ieronymos boarded a minibus and reached Lesbos port, to meet the local population and commemorate migrants who died on desperate sea journeys. In a short speech, Francis said walls are no answer to Europe's migration crisis, and identified fighting arms trade and trafficking \"and the often hidden machinations associated with them\" as part of the long-term solution. Francis, Bartholomew and Ieronymos then recited separate prayers and threw laurel wreaths in the sea. At least 732 migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean so far this year as they tried to flee poverty and violence, including 375 on the sea stretch between Greece and Turkey, the International Organization for Migration said Friday. Arriving in Lesbos, where he spent only five hours, Francis was greeted by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who heard the pontiff praise the Greeks' \"human stance\" towards migrants \"despite harsh economic strains,\" the Vatican said in a statement. Francis' trip to Lesbos, marking his 13th international journey, evoked comparisons with his 2013 foray to the Italian island of Lampedusa, another landing point for migrants bound for Europe which was the pope's first-ever trip outside the Vatican. # Notebook ## Note to editors - Adds pope denying political motives behind his gesture ## Internet links - Schedule of pope's trip, in Italian(https:\/\/press.vatican.va\/content\/salastampa\/it\/bollettino\/pu bblico\/2016\/04\/14\/0261\/00587.html) - Pope's message on Twitter(https:\/\/twitter.com\/Pontifex\/status\/721201476467499008) - IOM data on migrant deaths in the Mediterranean(http:\/\/missingmigrants.iom.int\/sites\/default\/files\/Med iterranean_Update_15_April_2016.pdf) - Pope's speech at Moria(https:\/\/press.vatican.va\/content\/salastampa\/it\/bollettino\/pubb lico\/2016\/04\/16\/0266\/00606.html#VISITA) - Joint declaration(https:\/\/press.vatican.va\/content\/salastampa\/it\/bollettin o\/pubblico\/2016\/04\/16\/0267\/00600.html#en) - Pope's speech at Lesbos port(https:\/\/press.vatican.va\/content\/salastampa\/it\/bollettino\/pubbl ico\/2016\/04\/16\/0271\/00599.html) - Vatican statement on relocation of 12 Syrian refugees(https:\/\/press.vatican.va\/content\/salastampa\/it\/bollettino\/p ubblico\/2016\/04\/16\/0273\/00623.html) * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Alvise Armellini in Rome and Miriam Schmidt aboard the papal plane - - Editing by: Rachel More, +49 30 2852 31472, dpa alv mms tt sdl shs rmo","label":0}

The state Division of Occupational Safety and Health's Standards Board was scheduled to vote later Thursday on a 21-page set of standards that would require, among other safety measures, that porn actors use condoms when they film sex scenes. One after another, the people who work both in front of and behind the camera filed to the dais at a hearing room in Oakland, California, to tell the board that would be wrong. Several said doing so would force the industry underground, prompting it to film in secret, which would essentially make all those involved criminals. They added it might also put an end to the industry's own requirement that actors be tested for sexually transmitted disease every 14 days. \"I ask you not to approve this policy that will endanger me and my colleagues,\" porn actress Maxine Holloway said during the hearing that continued for more than four hours. Under the 21-page proposal the agency is considering, so-called engineering controls \"such as condoms\" must be used by actors engaging in sex to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV and other diseases. Producers would also be required to pay for medical visits, treatments and other health-care costs for their performers. Some speakers said that if the rules take effect, Cal\/OSHA inspectors could also eventually begin ordering actors to use safety goggles and dental dams. \"That's pure fantasy on their part,\" Michael Weinstein, head of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, who has pushed Cal\/OSHA for years to adopt workplace safety rules aimed specifically at the porn industry, said before the hearing. Although the new provisions make no mention of goggles or dental dams, they do require that sex workers, like those in the medical industry, be sure their eyes are protected from being infected by blood-borne pathogens. Industry officials worry that, without goggles, that could put an end to oral sex scenes. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which also had several former porn actors scheduled to speak at the hearing, said the condom requirement is long overdue. One of the scheduled speakers, Derrick Burts, said he became infected with HIV while making porn films. \"People have suffered serious consequences due to lack of regulation in this industry,\" Weinstein said. Condoms are already required for films made in Los Angeles County, thanks to an AIDS Healthcare Foundation-sponsored ordinance that voters adopted in 2012. Weinstein has complained that filmmakers, who sometimes work out of houses they rent for just a day are two, sometimes ignore that law. Cal\/OSHA could enforce its regulations with, among other things, the kind of workplace visits it requires of other industries.","label":0}

The Gulf emirate called in the Iranian ambassador and handed him an official protest over the storming of the Saudi embassy in Tehran by demonstrators after the execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, Kuwait's official KUNA news agency reported. The report did not specify whether the Kuwaiti ambassador to Iran was being recalled for consultations or indefinitely. Kuwait is not the first majority Sunni country to take diplomatic steps against Iran in protest at the Shiite power's reaction to the execution. Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic relations with Iran on Sunday, angered by Tehran's vehement criticism, as well as the storming of the embassy. Riyadh's allies in Bahrain and Sudan followed suit Monday, while the United Arab Emirates recalled its ambassador and said it was downgrading diplomatic relations with Tehran. Bahrain on Tuesday announced a ban on flights to and from Iran, a step taken Monday by Saudi Arabia. Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, who had condemned the attack on the Saudi embassy, hit back at Riyadh during a meeting with Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen in Tehran. \"Of course, the Saudi government, in order to cover up its crime of beheading a religious leader, has resorted to a strange measure and has severed its ties with the Islamic Republic, whereas, undoubtedly, such moves will never hide that great crime,\" Rowhani said in remarks reported by government-run Press TV. Turkey added its voice to calls for calm, saying that Saudi Arabia and Iran were \"the two most important countries of the Islamic world\" and must find a way to reduce tensions. \"The political tension between these two countries can't contribute to peace in the region, which already resembles a powder keg,\" Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said in a Twitter post. Pakistan and Algeria have already joined the European Union and United States in calling for reconciliation, amid fears that the dispute will hamper peace efforts in Yemen and Syria, where Iran and Saudi Arabia support rival sides in the conflicts. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir met Tuesday in Riyadh with Staffan de Mistura, UN special envoy on Syria, who said there was a \"a clear determination on the Saudi side that the current regional tensions will not have any negative impact\" on the Syria peace process. Syria peace talks are due to resume January 25, in a process that for the first time is bringing both Saudi Arabia and Iran to the negotiating table. Along with Russia, Iran is the main outside backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Riyadh is a key supporter of rebel forces. In Washington, Brett McGurk, US special envoy for the global coalition against the Islamic State movement said the dispute between Iran and Saudi Arabia had not yet affected. Both Saudi Arabia and Iran oppose the Islamic State group, a Sunni extremist group that holds major swaths of Syria and neighbouring Iraq. In Washington, Brett McGurk, US special envoy for the global coalition against the Islamic State movement, said the dispute between Iran and Saudi Arabia had not yet affected the effort against Islamic State forces. \"So far, we have not seen impact on the overall anti-Islamic State campaign,\" he said at the State Deparment. He noted that US Secretary of State John Kerry \"was on the phone almost all day\" on Monday trying to defuse the diplomatic crisis. \"We are encouraging a de-escalation, because any time you have regional polarization, regional escalation, it obviously can cause difficulties, and it opens up seams for extremists on all sides to take advantage of the situation,\" McGurk said. \"Obviously, it's something that we're concerned about.\" The execution of al-Nimr, who was popular among disaffected members of Saudi Arabia's Shiite minority, has led to protests by Shiite Muslims across the region. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the killing - which was one of 47 executions, mostly of al-Qaeda-linked terrorist convicts, announced on Saturday - would lead to \"divine vengeance\" on Saudi Arabia's rulers. # Notebook ## Note to editors - Adds US envoy on impact for fighting Islamic State movement * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Pol O Gradaigh in Cairo, Can Merey and Linda Say in Istanbul, stringer in Bahrain, Emoke Bebiak in New York, Frank Fuhrig in Washington - Editing by: Gretel Johnston, +1 202-662-1241, dpa cy lsy shs pog ncs emb grj fff grj","label":1}

The hearing has been scheduled in the Knysna Regional court for November 17 to 28 - without the presence of Count Riccardo Agusta, the developer of the controversial Roodefontein Golf Estate near Plettenberg Bay. Count Agusta, who has skipped the country, was to have joined Marais and Malatsi in the dock, but the State has abandoned efforts  to secure his presence in court. The transfer of the case to Knysna was ordered by Cape Town Regional Court magistrate Hennie le Roux, on the grounds that most of the State witnesses were from the George, Knysna, and Plettenberg Bay vicinity. Marais and Malatsi face two corruption charges each, relating to  the Roodefontein development, while Malatsi faces additional theft and fraud charges. Le Roux said the case was likely to require a number of physical  inspections of the Roodefontein estate by the court. He rejected objections to the transfer by defence counsel Peter Mihalik, on behalf of Marais. Mihalik said the transfer of the case had enormous financial implications for Marais. Le Roux said the modern principles of transparency and the interests of justice demanded that justice be taken to the people involved in the case. He said the transfer would also avoid unnecessary State expense. Mihalik also objected to the delay of the case until November, but Le Roux said it was common for Regional Court cases to take up to, or more than, a year to start, even where accused persons were in custody. Le Roux said there were no grounds to criticise Scorpions specialist prosecutor Bruce Morrison, SC, for the delay, as contended by Mihalik. Le Roux said Morrison was in fact to be commended for ensuring Marais and Malatsi a speedy trial, by scheduling the hearing as soon as November. Malatsi is represented by counsel Hugo Rossouw.

Trichet told journalists he had already been forecasting an upward blip in inflation for some time. \"We're already observing it,\" he said. And area-wide inflation might therefore rise temporarily above the ECB's ceiling of 2.0 percent. \"But that doesn't change our assessment that inflation remains under control over the medium term. And therefore it was not appropriate to change our monetary policy stance,\" Trichet said.  Oil prices were clearly have an effect on headline inflation. But they tended to be \"very volatile,\" Trichet said. \"So we'll have  to see what happens.\" And the ECB chief indirectly urged the OPEC countries to act \"responsibly\" when it came to setting oil prices.  Oil prices surged this week to their highest levels since 1990 in the run-up to the Gulf War amid terrorist concerns and fears of a fuel shortage in the US.  Soaring oil prices are bad for the economy in two ways -- they fuel inflation and that could cause the ECB to raise rates to help put a lid on upward price pressures.

You don't speak about court matters on the street. Well be back here on the 8th of June as the court has directed. What we know is that when a person has been charged, it doesn't mean he's guilty of the charge. As they say in English, innocent until proven otherwise,\" he said in Zulu while speaking outside the court after the postponement. \"I'm amazed by the people who treat me as if I'm already convicted. Your being here shows that you understand the law and the Constitution, not those who cast aspersion. Lies and conspiracy will never prevail against the truth. I'm facing charges of buying arms when I was a provincial member of the executive council MEC and when it was national government which procured the arms. But let's leave that to the court. But my name has been already dragged through the mud.\" Zuma was appearing for a preliminary hearing and is accused number one in a case that relates to the multi-billion rand arms deal, which dates back to 1999. He is facing 16 charges, including fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering, for allegedly receiving bribes from French arms manufacturer Thales and from his former financial adviser, Shabir Shaik. Thales is accused number two, and was represented by Christine Guirrera, who had flown in from Paris, France and was seated in the dock at least forty minutes before Zuma arrived. The arms deal secured military equipment for the country's air, sea and land defence forces at a cost of more than R30 billion. Shaik was found guilty in 2005. He is currently serving a 15 year sentence at his upmarket Durban home on grounds of medical parole. Zuma told people on Friday, that he was going to challenge the National Prosecuting Authority's decision to reinstate the charges against him. He said that he would like the court to listen to the \"Spy Tapes and for the whole country to hear for itself what's in the tapes\". \"Because the judge in Pietermaritzburg...vindicated me that I was innocent, and that it was all a political conspiracy. There are people speaking in those tapes, not me, but everyone reporting on them refers to them as \"Zuma tapes\". I was not there, but the tapes are always linked to me,\" he said. \"It's obvious to me that the law-enforcement and political authorities think I must not enjoy my individual rights like any other citizen. They are lucky that we don't beat people up anymore. Even those with no serious power now have the courage to attack me. They are indeed lucky I don't beat up people. \"When they call me a dog I don't fight them because I know I'm not a dog. Even political newcomers have the courage to attack me, they tell me I must not campaign...I just look at them and see they know nothing. They are just new arrivals and don't know what to say.\" The court heard that a mutually agreed on postponement was being sought, with the next appearance provisionally set down for June 8. The postponement was needed as Zuma wanted to bring a review application of the case. The charges against Zuma were withdrawn in April 2009. In mid March, National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams announced that there was a reasonable prospect of conviction and said Zuma would be prosecuted for one count of racketeering, two counts of corruption, one count of money laundering and 12 counts of fraud. On Friday, Zuma said that he would continue to fight for the freedom of black people. \"A black person's struggle is heavy. When black people were sold off like commodities -- it was Africans who were the victims. It is Africa which took the brunt of colonial slavery. We are fighting for freedom, not with our mouths, but we were in the middle of the struggle. Now they are hating me for saying that our freedom is not complete,\" he said. \"That's why they are fighting and taking me to court because they fear I will open up people's eyes about their suffering. It's okay that I go to court, but things have to change and poverty come to an end. The economy must be in the hands of the poor. I thank you supporters that you are here to show that you are united and that our enemies cannot divide us.\" - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Devereaux Morkel","label":0}

The only mobile network available in parts of St Margarets at Cliffe, located on the famous White Cliffs near Dover just over 20 miles (32 kilometres) across the water from France, is French. And that can mean huge bills for residents and visiting tourists. \"We switch our mobile phones off when we're not really using them -- we switch them back on when we go out of the village,\" said Nigel Wydymus, landlord of the Coastguard pub and restaurant. \"It's more of a problem for tourists and visitors who come to have a walk on  the cliffs... as soon as they go to make their phone call, it will dial out but  it will go through the French network.\" Most people in Britain with mobile telephones sign up to a package which includes calls within the country, but calls made overseas are often excluded and charged at a much higher rate. \"I just got down here and my phone bleeped. It's a message from my phone supplier saying 'Welcome to France -- calls cost 28.8 pence per minute' to make. Which is unusual because obviously I'm still on the British Isles,\" said one man out walking on the cliffs. To find a British mobile phone signal, users have to head back up the steep cliffs to the church, where the weather vane on the roof doubles as the local transmitter. The oddity is irritating for locals but while the number of people affected remains small -- St Margarets has a permanent population of about 2,500 -- things are unlikely to change. Graeme Neill, deputy editor of Mobile Today magazine, said the only way to resolve the problem was to build more masts, something operators are currently unlikely to do after the recent huge investment in 3G. \"If you have a rural area, only maybe accessing a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand households, it wouldn't really give you a good return on investment,\" he told AFP.

The extra funding included 301 million NZ dollars (202.18 million U.S. dollars) over four years for the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) to undertake domestic, regional and international security risks, English said in the annual Budget to Parliament. The New Zealand Intelligence Community (NZIC) would receive an extra 179 million NZ dollars (120.23 million U.S. dollars) to remain effective in a rapidly evolving environment and 20 million NZ dollars (13.43 million U.S. dollars) for a new national Computer Emergency Response Team to fight cyber-attacks and cyber-crime. The government's 2016 Defence White Paper, which would be released soon, would confirm investment in major capabilities and infrastructure to deliver defense policy to 2030, Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee said in a statement. The new funding would give the NZDF greater options in responding to changes in the security environment and provide for increases in a wide range of operational areas, such as personnel, and costs associated with new and improved capabilities. \"It will also enable the continued introduction into service of new and upgraded capabilities and the regeneration of defense properties,\" Brownlee said.

Proper resourcing is critical in an increasingly complex international and domestic security landscape,\" Finlayson said. A two-year strategic capability resourcing review had analyzed the government's security and intelligence requirements and confirmed that significant investment was needed for the NZIC to remain effective. \"This investment allows significant staff recruitment and further extends the NZSIS's ability to respond to the threat from foreign terrorist fighters,\" he said.

Nxesi said the construction sector needed to deal with procurement, over-pricing, fraud and corruption. \"We will fail if we don't get on top of this challenge.\" He called on professionals within the sector to promote ethical practices. It was important for the country to get more construction management professionals. Nxesi said programmes needed to be taken to schools to provide support for promising pupils. \"We need to expedite the training and mentoring of graduates so that they attain full professional status in a shorter timeframe.\" Nxesi said more black people were needed in the sector. \"It cannot be right that after nearly 20 years of democracy, still only approximately 25 percent of built environment professionals are black,\" he said.

Ramos said the sale of the non-core asset -- which had been in process since October 2006 -- was part of the company's turnaround strategy which focused on freight transport. \"We believe we have a great deal with a great partner,\" she said. FNB was selected from eight other bidders because it had met all  the disposable criteria set by Transnet. These included price, profile and background and black economic empowerment. Both Transnet and FNB declined to name the other bidders, The transaction included a service level agreement that would ensure preferential rates for employees and about 220 Transnet staff -- located at the Carlton Centre head office and at 13 Transnet Housing Division loan centres --would be transferred to FNB. FNB would retain all employees for a 12-month period. The staff transfer would not include employees from Transnet's housing property portfolio which was responsible administering lodges and other properties. Ramos said the book had been sold because Transnet was not a financial services provider, nor did it aspire to be one. \"We are involved in building a world class freight transport and  logistics business. And this disposal takes us closer to that goal.\" She said the proceeds of the sale would go to financing the company. FNB's chief executive Michael Jordaan said negotiations with Ramos had been \"tough but fair\".  He said the bank had a pedigree for the successful acquisition of loan books through its housing, finance and home loan divisions. \"This has allowed FNB to make inroads into the lower income housing market,\" he said. Jordaan said FNB had entered into the retail market in 2005 and new housing projects in 2006. Under the financial sector charter, he said the company was committed to reaching a target for housing of R8,4 billion from 2004 to 2008. Currently, FNB has a total of 26 percent in direct and indirect black shareholding in South African operations.  Other discontinued non-core asset businesses, for which Transnet  was still in the process of negotiating sales, included SA Express,  Viamax, Freightdynamics, Autopax, Shosholoza Meyl, arivia.com and the Blue Train. \"We are hoping that this is the last financial year in which we have this handful of businesses for sale that have not been completed,\" she said. Ramos declined to comment on the value of the outstanding businesses as it would jeopardise Transnet's negotiating power with  potential buyers. \"We want to get the best value we can. We want to be able to negotiate,\" she said. The deal, which became effective on March 26, 2007, has yet to be approved by the Competition Commission and the Competition Tribunal. Sapa","label":0}

Lesufi held a consultative meeting at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg to share the priorities of his new term and to also to solicit inputs on the Education Roadmap 2019-2024. Education stakeholders, school principals and pupils were in attendance. He said that early child development would be part of the department's portfolio and no longer solely the social development portfolio. \"All primary schools must prepare to have grade R learners. Our infrastructure team is coming with infrastructure that these children must get.\" Lesufi said the department felt it was important to share their plans for the next couple of years. The MEC said that more teachers had to be trained to handle the new changes. Lesufi said grade R pupils would no longer only be sleeping and singing at school but would now have a curriculum that would assist them with learning. He said that schools would no longer tolerate late coming and said he gave principals permission to lock out late pupils. Lesufi said that teachers needed to stop behaving only when they work at former model C schools. Addressing the involvement of school governing bodies (SGBs), Lesufi said they were not allowed to rule schools but were there to provide oversight. \"Principals can't be appointed by a show of hands, there must be order and professionalism and a process on how to resolve our differences.\" Lesufi said the department was building a strong foundation which would allow the education sector to prosper. \"We are introducing a multi certificated learner, a learner that will have a certain skill on top of their matric certificate,\" he said. \"All grade 11s in Gauteng will have a K53 drivers license, all grade fours will have a certificate on gender so they know that a woman must not be abused but appreciate.\" Lesufi listed a number of certificates that would be awarded per grade which included sign language, first aid and drone flying. He said that he did not hate Afrikaans schools but wanted learners from all backgrounds to learn together. \"I will respect all 11 languages but not that the entire school must be a single language school. I'll defend non-racialism. There will now be tournaments between schools from all areas,\" Lesufi said. \"From 2021 all school uniforms must have the South African flag embroidered on them.\" He said there would a minimum of five people employed to township schools to assist with maintenance and cleaning. Lesufi said that whole education syllabus would be digital, connected to internet fibre and free wifi zones. Speaking on safety in schools, Lesufi called on SGBs to have disciplinary committees to ensure safety in schools. \"If someone attacks a teacher they are no longer a learner.\" He requested that information about bullies at schools should be sent to the district office. \"To learners, we are tired of your ill behaviour we want you to be a learner but if you want to be a criminal we will treat you like one. Every school will be assigned a police officer, we have agreed with the police to have them patrol schools.\" Lesufi said that a school safety system was being developed along with cell phone network companies that would make number nine an emergency alert. - African News Agency (ANA); Editing by Devereaux Morkel","label":0}

There were about 2200 of these complaints, where claims were declined because policy conditions were not met. \"This aspect smacks of poor administration and lack of proper client care on the part of these insurers and does not reflect well  on their efficiency,\" ombudsman Justice Peet Nienaber noted in the report. In the majority of these cases the claims were paid. Cases relating to claims refused because of non-disclosure however have been decreasing steadily, from over 200, since 2003. Preiss said in the past most complaints related to poor service. In 2005, the ombudsman received 8985 complaints, a 12 percent increase on 2004. Of the complaints in 2005, 5470 were classified upon completion as \"full cases\" which the office had to investigate actively. These  were divided into standard, complicated -- due to the nature of the  case -- or incompetent -- where the insurer's response was inadequate. Both of the latter categories increased substantially over the past year. \"What is disappointing is the continuing upward trend in incompetent cases -- typified by tardiness, lack of commitment or efficiency on the part of insurers in dealing with complaints after  they had reached our office,\" Nienaber wrote in the report. These had increased by 46 percent. The chairman of the ombudsman's council noted in the report that  the increase in the number of complaints could be due to greater dissatisfaction with insurers generally. \"But it can also simply mean that more policies are sold overall  with a corresponding increase in complaints,\" wrote Judge Gerald Friedman. The number of cases resolved in favour of complainants increased  to 42 percent. Nienaber said the office hesitated to \"name and shame\" insurers as it could achieve better results by not naming them. \"One of the advantages of confidentiality is that you can get the insurer to make concessions,\" he said. The life insurance industry should blame itself for the public's  negative perceptions about it. \"In remodelling themselves as money-making organisms, insurers as a body neglected... their policyholders,\" he added.

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and visiting Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn witnessed the signing of the agreements on cooperation in areas including oil and gas, health, sports, education, animal health and sanitary measures. The two countries vowed to further deepen their cordial bilateral relations, according to a joint statement signed in Nairobi. In the oil and gas sector, the two countries will construct a crude oil pipeline that will run from the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu. The pipeline is part of the Lamu Port-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor project, which runs through the two countries and aims to transform infrastructure in the towns and counties across its path. The two leaders lauded the progress being made on cross-border security through a Joint Borders Administrators Framework, which was set up last year to deal with anti-peace elements along the common borders. They committed to elevating the bilateral economic relations through the implementation a Special Status Agreement aimed at enhancing trade and investment between the two countries. Once the Special Status Agreement is fully implemented with the elimination of both tariffs and non-tariff barriers, market access between the two countries will be improved, which will therefore benefit the flow of goods and services. Speaking at a joint news conference, Kenyatta said Ethiopia was an invaluable partner for Kenya in issues ranging from the economy to regional peace building, noting the two countries were working closely on the Lamu Port-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor project. He said the two nations would continue to work closely on security issues in the wider region and also along their common borders, including efforts to help bring stability and peace to Somalia and the region at large. The two leaders stressed the key role that African countries must continue to play in the pursuit of peace and security on the African continent. Desalegn said his country considered neighboring Kenya as a strategic partner and a natural friend given the similarities the two countries share. Desalegn said the two nations were important for the stability of the region as well as the whole of Africa. \"Kenya and Ethiopia are the pillars of the region and we have to work together to stabilize the region,\" said Desalegn, adding that Ethiopia will always stand ready to support Kenya in all fields.

The capital Kinshasa was calm after Tuesday's clashes pitting riot police and UN peacekeeping troops against supporters of Jean-Pierre Bemba, who lost a presidential poll last month on the final provisional results. \"No incidents were reported during the night. We have resumed our patrols,\" Lieutenant-Colonel Thierry Fusalba of a European Union military force deployed to back the UN mission in DRC (MONUC)  told AFP. Troops of the new Congolese army, which is still being formed after the war that ravaged the vast country from 1998 to 2003, stood guard over the main Supreme Court building, which was partly looted and burned by the rioters. Three UN armoured cars were posted over the road, part of a joint MONUC-DRC army task force that was set up \"until further notice\", according to an announcement after the riots by army chief  of staff General Gabriel Amisi. \"We are there. It's calm, but we'll intervene if there is new provocation and if firearms are used again in the city,\" said a Congolese army officer who asked not to be named. During Tuesday's violence, which began with a protest at the Supreme Court by about 200 Bemba supporters, members of his armed guard at his residence, not far from the court premises in central Kinshasa, opened fire on riot police. No casualties were reported, but the presence in the city of about 1,000 soldiers loyal to Bemba has increased tension before and since the election. In August, at least 23 people died when they battled Kabila's presidential guard. Bemba filed a suit on Saturday to contest results given by the Independent Electoral Commission after his defeat in the October 29  election by President Joseph Kabila, who has for three years headed  a transitional government in which Bemba became one of four vice presidents. According to the commission, Kabila took 58 percent of the votes  against 42 percent for Bemba, but the wealthy businessman and former rebel and his aides have pointed to irregularities in the poll and ballot count. The Supreme Court had a week to consider Bemba's case once he presented his challenge before it last weekend. Sapa-AFP","label":1}

Spokesperson Lt-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the case against the man, from Mariveni village near near Nkowankowa outside Tzaneen, was postponed to Friday, for the social worker's report and for further investigations. \"It is alleged that the four victims, aged 12, 14, 14, and 16, who were ushers in the suspect's Church at Burgersdorp near Tzaneen were raped by a well-known pastor and who is also calling himself a prophet from December 2016, until August 2017,\" Ngoepe said. \"Allegations are that this pastor raped all these victims inside the church on different dates after he invited them one by one to come to the church for prayer and while busy praying, he will then attack the victim and rape her.\" Ngoepe said investigations continue. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Current legislation laid the burden of proof with the rape survivor to show she had not given consent. A rape survivor's sexual history or even what she was wearing could be discussed in court to show \"her word can't be trusted,\" said Shelver. She said moves to introduce revised legislation had been going on for nine years with no clear indication of when they would proceed again. Shelver cited a gang rape case scheduled to resume next week as an example of how court delays defeated justice. She said a women who had been raped by seven men had begun giving her testimony on October 2, 2005. On August 16 this year she would finally complete this process. \"As long as a rape survivor has to take the stand her healing process is delayed... every time you testify in court it takes you back  again.\" Shelver said the tragedy of the case was that two of the men arrested for the rape had been released and subsequently rearrested for  committing armed robbery while out on bail. Meanwhile, the rape survivor remained in a shelter because her safety could not be guaranteed. Shelver said while some court delays were understandable, others such as mislaid dockets were \"purely errors\". About a dozen protesters gathered outside the court a day after Women's Day celebrations, some chained to the court fence and others with their mouths taped closed. \"Rape is living murder,\" read one placard. Another read: \"Reporting rape equals being raped again in court\". An advocate walking out of the high court said he had not yet looked  at the protest but did support it. \"Men must support them completely,\" he said. Mandla Shangweni, 41, who was walking past the protest said: \"Men have a big role to play. We need to teach our fellow brothers to act in  a responsible way... forcing oneself on a person, at the end of the day it destroys her feelings.\" Sapa","label":1}

A key sticking point in the work of the commission is the position of former foes from Mozambique's brutal civil war, the ruling FRELIMO party and the opposition RENAMO. FRELIMO - which stands for the Mozambique Liberation Movement - has ruled the southeastern African country since ousting Portuguese  colonial rulers in 1975. It wants its former fighters to be given preferential treatment, said Hermenegildo Gamito, commission chairman. It has submitted an amendment instructing the state \"to give special protection to those disabled during the national liberation  struggle, as well as the orphans and other dependents of those who died in this cause.\" RENAMO - a Portuguese acronym for the Mozambican Resistance Movement -which waged a brutal 16-year civil war against FRELIMO, wants this \"special protection\" for its former combatants. It is also pushing for its military campaign, it calls \"the struggle for democracy\" to be given equal status to that of Frelimo's \"liberation struggle.\" Mozambique emerged from the civil war in 1992. Lawmakers have urged the commission to speed up its work so that  a new constitution can be adopted by late 2004. The commission has also made little progress in designing a new flag and national emblem, Gamito said. The Commission also complained that its budget was insufficient,  and did not allow it to meet regularly in the intervals between parliamentary sittings. The socialist FRELIMO party has gradually converted to free market policies since 1994. Sapa-AP","label":0}

The Ferhat Pasha mosque \u2014 also called Ferhadija \u2014 was a masterpiece of 16th-century Ottoman architecture and one of the 16 mosques in Banja Luka \u2014 or one of the 534 throughout the country \u2014 that were destroyed or damaged by Bosnian Serbs in order to erase any traces of those they were expelling or killing. Their aim was to make that part of Bosnia a apart of neighboring Serbia. The so-called \"ethnic cleansing\" project, also targeting Roman Catholic Croats and other non-Serbs, included expelling people from their homes, looting their property, killing some and putting others in concentration camps. The destruction of their heritage was an essential part of the plan, aimed also at discouraging survivors from returning. In 1995, after over 100,000 people were killed, a peace agreement divided the country in two halves \u2014 one for the Serbs, where Banja Luka ended up, and the other shared by Croats and Muslim Bosniaks. The agreement guaranteed refugees the right to return to their prewar homes and reconstruction of the Ferhadija mosque was to encourage the plan. But an attempt in 2001 to lay a foundation stone was disrupted by a Serb nationalist mob. One Muslim visitor was killed and dozens were injured. NATO forces had to evacuate foreign ambassadors from the ceremony by helicopters. Activists located fragments of the mosque that were not thrown into the river or the garbage dump, separated them and used computers to place the over 3,500 fragments where they belong. Reconstruction took 15 years. On Saturday \u2014 the 23rd anniversary of the Ferhadija destruction \u2014 Bosnian Serb authorities deployed over 1,000 policemen to secure the event, attended by outgoing Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Bosnian leaders, foreign ambassadors and representatives of the Roman Catholic, Serb Orthodox Churches and the Jewish Community. The event symbolized a further push to restore Bosnia's multifaith and multi-ethnic fabric. Turkey and other international donors as well as Serbs donated funds for the reconstruction. During the war, Serbs often referred to Muslims as \"Turks,\" explaining their actions as revenge for hundreds of years of Ottoman occupation. At the ceremony in Banja Luka, Davutoglu said: \"We were here once, we are here now and we will always stay here.\" Jakob Finci, leader of Bosnia's Jewish Community, said in his speech that rarely a Jew speaks at the opening of a mosque but in Bosnia it was possible. He as well as Catholic bishop Franjo Komarica and Serb Orthodox priest Jefrem welcomed the opening of the mosque and the people who will pray in it. \"Our differences are not a historical mistake,\" said Husein Kavazovic, the leader of Bosnia's Islamic Community. \"They are God's gift, and any violence against those differences is an act against God's will.\"","label":1}

According to PAC spokesman Waters \"Bishop\" Toboti, about 20 heavily armed policemen jumped over farm fences at 4.30pm on Thursday and, without a warrant, searched every room and cabinet in  the house. His maid was questioned about movements at the house and, according to Toboti, Makwetu now believes he is under surveillance. In the letter, Nqakula is asked if the department regards Makwetu as an anti-government element, or whether the government has a political agenda to intimidate him into remaining a recluse on his farm. \"We are very disturbed by this turn of events,\" said Toboti. He said the police action contradicted President Thabo Mbeki's honouring Makwetu for his contribution to the country's liberation struggle. Makwetu is one of the founders of the PAC. However, Eastern Cape police spokesman Superintendent Gcinikaya Taleni said that on the day in question police were searching the area after an attempted robbery. The gang had last been seen passing the farm so police informed Makwetu what was happening and asked for permission \"to look around\". The robbers were not found. \"They were given permission (to search),\" said Taleni. Makwetu dismissed the explanation. \"That is a lie,\" he said, continuing: \"They invaded the farm.\" He was told police were looking for a group implicated in a robbery 60km away. The police also remarked about the movement of people at his house on a certain night, which led him to believe he was under surveillance. Taleni said police would look into the matter. PAC leader Dr Motsoko Pheko condemned the search \"in the strongest terms\". \"It is disrespect of our former president,\" he said on Monday. He said police raided his own constituency office in the Free State about two years ago in July, without giving reasons. \"They have to this minute not explained anything.

She then applied to the court to have sections of the DA Constitution used to expel her from the party declared unlawful.

It's complicated but it boils down to a struggle for wealth, ethnic animosity and a lack of central government control. Here are some of the issues: --- THE COUNTRY Congo is sub-Saharan Africa's biggest country, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to two-thirds of the way across the continent. It is plagued by a lack of roads and railways. The feeble government in the capital Kinshasa is nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away from Goma, the strategic eastern town that was seized by M23 rebels on Nov. 20. A succession of rebel groups and  warlords have for years taken advantage of the power vacuum to get a piece of the mining action in eastern Congo. --- MINERALS Eastern Congo is estimated to have mineral deposits worth trillions of dollars, according to mining experts. The area holds about 70 percent of the world's supply of tantalum, a metal used in cellphones, tablets, laptops and other computers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The eastern region also has massive amounts of gold, tin, tungsten, copper, coltan and cobalt. Much of the ore mined is smuggled out of Congo and passes through Rwanda, Uganda or Burundi, according to the Enough Project, a Washington-based organization campaigning against conflict minerals. Some 450,000 artisanal miners work in eastern Congo, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. --- M23 REBELS The M23 rebel group was formed almost eight months ago by former members of a now defunct insurgent group that had been incorporated into the Congolese army as part of a March 23, 2009, peace agreement. The new group was created by  the former rebels who deserted from the army. Their name refers to the date of the peace agreement, which M23 accuses the government of not honoring. Since May, M23 has seized territory in North Kivu province, culminating last week with the capture of Goma, a lakeside city of 1 million and a key trading hub bordering Rwanda. --- THE TERMINATOR M23 is believed to have been created by warlord Bosco \"The Terminator\" Ntaganda, who had been a leader of the former rebel group, the National Congress for the Defense of the People, or CNDP. The CNDP was backed by Rwanda,  which also allegedly arms and gives other support to M23. As part of the 2009 agreement, Ntaganda, Ntaganda was made was made a general in the army and deputy commander for an operation meant to go after a militia made of Hutus who  took part in Rwanda's genocide. In early 2012, Congolese President Joseph Kabila came under international pressure to arrest Ntaganda and transfer him to  the Hague to face war crimes charges in the International Criminal Court. Ntaganda, avoided immediate arrest, launched a mutiny and was joined by some loyal men who are believed to have formed M23. Kabila, whose father had led a rebellion in 1997 that toppled dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, had also vowed to dismantle a parallel chain of command that Ntaganda established in eastern Congo's North Kivu and South Kivu provinces. Ntaganda had operated lucrative businesses with other army officers in the east, including a smuggling racket taking minerals into neighboring Rwanda, according to a U.N. report released on  Nov. 21. --- RWANDA Rwanda has backed rebels groups in eastern Congo as a defense against other militias of Hutu extremists, many responsible for Rwanda's 1994 genocide, who operate in east Congo. But many analysts also think Rwanda is motivated to support sympathetic power networks in the east so that it can profit from the export of smuggled Congolese minerals. M23's success has been due to direct support from powerful figures in Rwanda and neighboring Uganda, according to U.N. investigators researching the conflict in eastern Congo. The report says that high-ranking Rwandan government and army figures, most notably Defense Minister James Kabarebe and Chief of Defense Staff Charles Kayonga, have supported the M23 by providing recruits, sophisticated arms, ammunition and finances. Rwanda also wants to use M23 as a Tutsi force to counter the Hutu rebels of the FDLR, also operating in eastern Congo, said the U.N. report. The Rwandan government of President Paul Kagame vehemently denies it supports M23. --- UGANDA Uganda has also supported the M23, although on a smaller scale, said the U.N. report. This has allegedly been driven by a few powerful Ugandans intent on profiteering from access to Congo's rich mineral resources. Uganda denies supporting M23. The rebels feel comfortable in Uganda and can come and go as they wish. Their external relations official is now based in Kampala, Uganda's capital. The U.N. report did not accuse Uganda of orchestrating an official policy of backing the rebels, but it said some within the military were using their influence to procure arms and ammunition for the rebels. The U.N. investigators even claim that units of the Rwandan and Ugandan armies have fought alongside M23 soldiers against the Congolese army. A \"mixed brigade\" of Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers allegedly numbered more men than the massed ranks of the M23 forces, said the U.N. report. --- WHAT'S NEXT The Congolese army - underfed, poorly supplied and rarely paid - have repeatedly retreated in the face of M23 attacks. Even if the rebels withdraw from Goma now, military experts say the well-organized, well-supplied M23 will remain to seize the key city again. U.N. investigators claim that the ultimate goal of M23 and Rwanda is the annexation of the North and South Kivu provinces and the region's mineral wealth. They say the battle for Goma may be just the beginning of a long and bloody conflict for control of eastern Congo. Sapa-AP \/sdv\/th","label":0}

Barnabas Sentiwe, dressed in a blue tracksuit, kept his head down and his hands clasped while details of a plea and sentencing agreement into which he entered on Thursday were read out in court. The 37-year-old agreed to a 20-year jail term for killing Constable Monwabisi Mnyombolo. However, the State conceded to a 15-year sentence after it confirmed certain  provisions of the Criminal Procedures Act were not relevant. The act prescribes a life sentence for those who kill police officers performing their functions, whether on duty or not. Judge Robert Henney said the circumstances in this case were different, in that Sentiwe's neighbour happened to be a policeman and his death was the result of a private matter. Sentiwe admitted going to the policeman's house on October 24, 2009, and accusing him of having an affair with his wife, Phumza Veli, a co-accused in the case. Sentiwe stabbed Mnyombolo during the ensuing argument. He then carried the body to his home in Mfuleni and buried it in the backyard. He sold the house in April the next year. In May 2011, the owners saw a piece of cloth sticking out of the sand, pulled it, and discovered a pair of pants with bones. Forensic tests were done and the bones were identified as belonging to Mnyombolo. Henney said he had considered Sentiwe's personal circumstances; namely that he was a first offender, had four children, and had been in custody for 15 months. \"However, the fact he the policeman was buried in a shallow grave and left there is a despicable act which cannot be condoned,\" the judge said in accepting 15 years as a just sentence. The State withdrew the charges against Veli, who was accused as an accessory  after the fact. Sapa  \/je\/fg\/clh\/jk","label":0}

The US unit was initially buoyed by renewed expectations of a US  rate hike but solid local stocks and yen-buying by exporters halted  the dollar's advance after encouraging Japanese economic data, they  said. \"Players are adjusting their positions after the dollar gained sharply overnight,\" said Tetsuya Aida, dealer at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. The dollar stood at 109.85 yen, off at intraday high of 110.54 reached in early trade and down from 110.36 yen in New York Wednesday. The euro was at 1.2050 dollars, up from 1.2038 dollars in New York, and at 132.36 yen, down from 133.05. Market analysts said that the increasingly positive outlook for Japan's economic recovery after a series of data prompted speculators to buy the unit. \"The dollar's topside was weighed on by yen-buying from exporters. Also Japanese shares were rising. That was also pressuring the dollar against the yen,\" Aida said. On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the headline Nikkei index was 117.71 points or 1.03 percent higher at 11,567.45 points in mid-afternoon trade. The dollar spiked up in overseas markets, advancing to the 110 yen level from 108.72 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday, in a delayed reaction to Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's hint about aggressive moves to boost US interest rates. \"The sharp rise of the dollar overnight was somewhat surprising.  The dollar started strongly in Tokyo as well this morning but a lack of fresh leads, position adjustment, and real demand for the yen put the dollar within the current range,\" Aida said. In early afternoon Singapore trade, the dollar rose to 1,159.9 South Korean won from 1,154.2 on Wednesday, to 40.64 Thai baht from  40.60, 9,393 Indonesian rupiah from 9,360, 55.75 Philippine pesos from 55.67 and to 33.513 Taiwan dollars from 33.423.

Madikizela-Mandela resigned as a Member of Parliament, women's league president, and a member of the ANC's national executive committee last year after her conviction on dozens of fraud and theft charges. She was sentenced to five years in jail, of which eight months had to be served in prison and the rest as community service. An appeal against her conviction was pending. ANC spokesman Steyn Speed said neither Madikizela-Mandela's criminal conviction nor her resignation from Parliament precluded her from being on the list. He could not say, though, why her name was not listed. \"I don't know if it was that she was not nominated or whether she declined to stand.\" Former ANC chief whip Tony Yengeni, convicted of fraud last year, also is not on the list. Yengeni undertook not to make himself available for public office after the ANC instituted disciplinary steps against him. It suspended his membership of the party for five years -- which sanction was conditionally suspended for three years. Yengeni's wife, Lumka, is number 62 on the list. Other names missing from the list were those of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister Valli Moosa, Justice Minister Penuell Maduna, and former Housing Minister Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele. Moosa and Maduna have both retired from active politics, while Mthembi-Mahanyele last year took up the full-time position of ANC deputy secretary-general. President Thabo Mbeki heads the national list, followed by his deputy Jacob Zuma. Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is number three on the list, followed by Education Minister Kader Asmal, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza and Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota. Number eight is Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour, followed by Public Service and Administration Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi. Four ANC premiers had been moved from the provinces to the national candidates list. They are Manne Dipico of the Northern Cape, Popo Molefe of the North West, Ngoako Ramathlodi of Limpopo, and Winkie Direko of the Free State. Dipico is number 10 on the list. Speed said Dipico, Molefe and Ramathlodi had all served the maximum of two terms allowed by the constitution. He could not explain Direko's move, saying only it was the result of the party's  \"list process\". Mpumalanga premier Ndaweni Mahlangu was number two on the party's list for that province, after by Siphosezwe Masango. This did not necessarily mean Mahlangu would not be re-elected premier, Speed said. \"The process of selecting premiers is a separate one.\" Number one on the Northern Cape list was Tina Joemat-Petterson, on the North West list, Darkey Africa, on the Limpopo list Sello Moloto, and for the Free State, Ace Magashule. Eastern Cape premier Makhenkesi Stofile remained first on his provincial list, as did Mbhazima Shilowa of Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal party chairman Sbu Ndebele, and Western Cape chairman Ebrahim Rasool. The ANC submitted its candidates lists to the Independent Electoral Commission earlier in the day, with a registration fee of  R420,000 for contesting the poll nationally and in all nine provinces. \"The ANC's candidates are the most committed, capable, experienced and representative group of candidates any party contesting this election has to offer,\" a party statement read.

Britain's oldest and longest-serving monarch celebrated her birthday Thursday, the same day Obama opened what likely is the final visit here of his presidency. The two heads of state were sitting down to lunch Friday at the castle, west of London. Afterward, Obama planned to have dinner with Prince William, his wife Kate and brother Prince Harry at the younger royals' Kensington Palace home in central London. William is second in line to inherit the British throne after his father, Prince Charles. Obama's wife, Michelle, was flying in from Washington to attend the royal engagements. The queen's husband, Prince Philip, was also attending the lunch. Obama was breaking up his royal holiday with a stop at 10 Downing St. for talks with Prime Minister David Cameron about the multinational campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as counterterrorism efforts, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, the global economy, Russia's stance toward Ukraine and other issues Political issues in the United Kingdom and the U.S., including Britain's possible exit from the European Union, or Brexit, are on the agenda, along with the U.S. presidential campaign that will determine Obama's successor. Cameron is leading the campaign in favor of Britain's continued membership in the 28-nation EU, which Obama also supports. He wants Obama to speak out against severing ties, but voters will have the final say in a June 23 referendum. Cameron faces opposition from within his own Conservative government and widespread skepticism among voters about the benefits of staying in the EU. Backers of those who support Britain's exit, meanwhile, have accused Obama of hypocrisy and interference. In an opinion piece published online Thursday by the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Obama urges Britons to stay in the EU. He notes the decision will affect U.S. interests and says \"The U.S. and the world need your outsized influence to continue - including within Europe.\" Another issue that could come up is Obama's criticism of Cameron in an interview published recently in The Atlantic magazine. In the article, Obama faulted Cameron and other European allies for shortcomings in their handling of Libya after the 2011 toppling of leader Moammar Gadhafi. Obama said Cameron had become \"distracted\" by other issues. Libya has since descended into chaos and become a haven for members of the Islamic State group. Obama's lunch with the queen is the latest in a series of engagements between the two families since he took office in 2009. \"Each time, the president has come away with an even deeper personal affection for her,\" said Obama spokesman Josh Earnest. \"She is an important symbol of a country with whom the United States has a special relationship. But she also is a human being whose charisma and a sense of nobility and honor is something that I think people around the world are attracted to.\" Obama described the queen as \"delightful\" following their first meeting in 2009. He also told an aide that she reminded him of his grandmother. That meeting is also where the queen and the much-taller Mrs. Obama showed how quickly they took a liking to each other by briefly standing arm in arm at a Buckingham Palace reception for world leaders attending an economic summit in London. The queen strayed from protocol by wrapping an arm around the first lady, who reciprocated. A palace spokesman at the time described the scene at the ladies' first meeting as a \"mutual and spontaneous display of affection.\" The queen subsequently hosted Obama for a state visit in May 2011, during which the president and first lady slept at the palace. Obama and the queen also met in June 2014 during ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France. Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, and William and Harry, have all visited Obama in the Oval Office. Harry, a military veteran who served in Afghanistan, joined Mrs. Obama for a White House event in 2013. In 2015, they met at a U.S. military base to highlight their shared interest in the needs of military families and wounded service members. She and daughters Malia and Sasha also sipped tea with Harry at Kensington Palace when the first lady stopped in London last year. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter:","label":0}

Ndebele was speaking at the 4th Durban Economic Growth Summit hosted by the Durban Growth Coalition (DGC) at the ICC in Durban this morning. Ndebele said that the province had a lot to learn from Asian countries such as Japan, China and Malaysia because of the way in which they had transformed their economics. \"There was a  lot of prejudice against these countries as they were associated with shoddy work because of primitive ethnology they were using. But today they are economically advanced countries in the world,\" said Ndebele. He said these were examples that should inspire Durban if one were to look at what those countries had achieved. Ndebele said that the economic success of those countries could be ascribed to the partnerships that were formed between the public and the private sector. \"This is what the Durban Growth Coalition seeks to achieved,\" said Ndebele. He said that Durban, as the only diversified city in the world in terms of culture and race, was in a better position to achieve economic success. \"Unlike Japan which exported intellectual capacity, Durban is exporting skilled people, mostly Africans and Indians to Johannesburg and these are the shortcomings that we want  to address,\" he said. He praised some private companies including Mondi for the commitment they have shown in fast tracking black economic empowerment through the deals they have entered into with other black empowerment companies. \"As government we have set an example through Durban Transport by outsourcing it to a company that reflects the demographics of this country. This is how we are going  attract business professionals in Durban,\" said Ndebele. As the country moves towards the general elections, Ndebele said  that there were perceptions that KwaZulu-Natal would not have peaceful elections. \"We have had four elections in this country and  the most volatile one was in 1994. Therefore on what basis do we say we should go back to 1994 because the local government elections in 1996 and the general elections in 1999 were peaceful? said Ndebele. He said people had become politically mature and they  were moving on to create economic growth for the province. Ndebele is also co-chairman of the Durban Growth Coalition, a public private partnership established in 2000 to untangle, among other things, political, economical and social knots that prevent economic growth.

Chief Executive Jim McNerney dismissed the notion of a tapering-off in orders for commercial jets amid sizzling sales of the 787, which has racked up 567 customer orders from at least 44 different customers even before the first model rolls off the assembly line. \"The U.S. and European legacy carriers have yet to order in any substantial quantities,\" he said in a response to an analyst's question at the meeting, which was webcast. \"So we don't see an immediate end to the cycle.\" Boeing held to forecasts for earnings of between {dollar}4.55 and {dollar}4.75  per share in 2007 on revenue between {dollar}64.5 billion (?47.81 billion)  and {dollar}65 billion (?48.18 billion). In 2008, profits are expected to grow to {dollar}5.55-{dollar}5.75 per share on revenue of {dollar}71 billion (?52.63 billion) to {dollar}72 billion (?53.37 billion). \"No matter how you look at it, Boeing is off to a strong start in 2007,\" said Chief Financial Officer James Bell. The Chicago-based company last month reported 27 percent higher first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street projections. McNerney said then that it is on pace to overtake Airbus in airplane deliveries by early next year, helped by the momentum generated by the 787. The new plane is scheduled to enter commercial service next May.  It's the first commercial jet that will be made mostly of light, sturdy carbon-fiber composites instead of aluminum and is said to be 20 percent more fuel-efficient than comparable jets. Boeing said it is on track to roll out the first plane by July 8, which will be used for test flights slated to begin around late August.

The European Union executive reiterated its long-held view that a 1960 law that privatised the auto giant was illegal under EU rules allowing for the free movement of capital. \"This law prevents anyone from gaining control or even a significant influence over strategic decisions concerning Volkswagen,\" commission spokesman Jonathan Todd told reporters. He said the commission would have preferred the German government to have heeded its March ultimatum to amend the law. \"They have not done so, and therefore we have little choice but to refer Germany to the Court of Justice,\" Todd said. The \"Volkswagen Law\" forbids shareholders from holding more than  20 percent of the carmaker's voting rights, even if the shareholder  has a bigger stake in its capital. In addition, important decisions on Volkswagen's future require the approval of at least 80 percent of shareholders. Those provisions, according to Brussels, give special blocking powers to Volkswagen's biggest shareholder, the federal state of Lower Saxony, which has an 18.1 percent stake in the company. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder late Wednesday defended the law as \"absolutely compatible with European law\" and rejected the commission's decision. \"The European Commission is really stubborn and I cannot accept\"  its decision, Schroeder said at a joint news conference in Rome with Italian President Silvio Berlusconi. The German government earlier had expressed its \"regret\" over the legal action but said it was confident that the EU's top court would rule in its favour. \"We regret the decision by the EU commission to take Germany to the European Court of Justice,\" the German Justice Ministry said in  a statement. \"As we see it there is no doubt that the aspects of the VW Law criticised by the commission are compatible with EU law,\" it said. Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries said: \"In particular, the government sees no obstacles to the free flow of capital in the single market. \"We're optimistic that we'll be able to refute the commission's arguments when the case goes to court,\" she added. A spokesman for the Lower Saxony government also said he was confident the commission's lawsuit would fail. \"We are relaxed about this whole matter,\" the spokesman said. \"Naturally we regret the EU decision to sue the German government but we believe the Volkswagen law does not contravene the EU laws.\" A Volkswagen spokesman at the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg declined to comment on the lawsuit. \"We are not the party  involved in the whole procedure,\" he said. EU internal market commissioner Frits Bolkestein has been trying  in vain for three years to persuade the German government to change  the law.  The commission backed Bolkestein's case for legal action now rather than waiting for a new EU executive to take charge on November 1. The Dutch commissioner has argued that the special protection accorded to Volkswagen is no different from \"golden shares\" retained by EU governments in privatised companies to protect them against foreign takeover bids. The European Court of Justice in June 2002 upheld the commission's ruling that France's golden share in oil major TotalFinaElf broke EU rules. Brussels argues such judgements form a  precedent against the VW Law. Sapa-AFP","label":0}

The number of infections has gone up by 28 since last week, including by five pregnant women, the secretariat noted. The southern state of Chiapas accounts for the most number of infections at 57 people, according to the secretariat's General Directorate of Epidemiology. It is followed by 52 in neighboring Oaxaca, four in the northeastern state of Nuevo Leon and three in Guerrero. Five additional states have registered one Zika case each. The virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which is common in tropical areas of the Americas. Pregnant women who contract the virus often give birth to babies with a severe birth defect characterized by small heads and underdeveloped brains. Among the general population, Zika poses little threat. Most people show no symptoms, and those that do suffer mild discomfort that ends in a week or less. There is evidence that men can transmit the virus to sexual partners long after exposure and long after any symptoms disappear. Another study provided evidence that the virus may cause the Guillain-Barre syndrome, affecting the immune and nervous systems that cause non-trauma related paralysis.","label":0}

The growth estimate was slightly more optimistic than the Bank of Israel's forecast, which last week said it saw gross domestic product growing by 4.5 percent in 2005. If the CBS's prediction proves correct, it would be the largest growth of the domestic economy since the outbreak of the intifada in 2000, when growth stood at 7.7 percent. Since then, the Israeli economy has plunged into the worst recession since the Jewish state was created in 1948. The crisis has been fuelled by the last five years of bloodshed and the slump in the global high-tech sector which started at the end of 2000. Despite the signs of economic growth, there has been little impact on the abject poverty across much of Israel where in 2004, 1.5 million Israelis lived below the poverty line, up 108,000 from the previous year. Former finance minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to muster popular support for his package of austerity measures seeking to kickstart the struggling economy. Netanyahu resigned in August in opposition to Israel's pullout from the Gaza Strip, a withdrawal seen by the financial community as a major opportunity to re-energise an economy battered by five years of violence.

This year's World No Tobacco Day, a project of the World Health Organisation, is focusing on 100% smoke-free environments as the only effective measure to protect the public - including women and children, and people at their workplaces - from exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.  CANSA supports the national government's new anti-tobacco legislation, which will soon become law. CANSA is also calling on all those who smoke to quit the deadly habit.  Every year over 25 000 South Africans die of tobacco-related illnesses. Globally over 5 million deaths are due to tobacco every year. These figures do not include all those who are critically ill  from smoking or breathing in second-hand smoke. Apart from many kinds of cancer, smoking also can cause heart attacks, strokes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, peptic ulcers and even impotence.  Tobacco and second-hand smoke contain over 4 500 chemicals including nicotine, which is what makes tobacco so addictive. Smoke  from the burning end of a cigarette has more toxins than smoke inhaled by the smoker.   Children who breathe second-hand smoke are more likely to get colds, allergies, middle ear infections, and \"glue ear\", which is the most common cause of deafness in children.  Exposure to second-hand smoke and smoking while pregnant are both linked to miscarriage, low birth weight and stillborn births. There is also evidence that postnatal exposure of infants to second-hand smoke contributes to the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  What can be done about second-hand smoke?   a.. Strive to make your home, workplace, school and community smoke-free.  b.. Support the new anti-tobacco legislation, which protects non-smokers from the dangers of passive smoking.  c.. If your workplace or school does not yet comply with the new  legislation, help develop a smoke-free policy at work and at school.  d.. Don't allow smokers to smoke around you or your children, or  in your home.  e.. If you live with smokers, set up a place outside where they can smoke, and help them to quit.  f.. If you smoke, do not smoke in enclosed areas such as homes, offices or cars where others may be exposed to second-hand smoke.  g.. If anyone is smoking in a public place or in a no-smoking zone, complain to the manager.   h.. Support restaurants and other places that have become 100% smoke-free.   \"Tobacco is one of the biggest causes of cancer. Let's work together to fight cancer and save lives,\" Janse van Rensburg says.

The young jockey would have been pinching himself to have just landed a ride in the big race as he was a replacement for the originally declared rider Weichong Marwing. Van der Hoven was obviously not able to claim his usual 2,5kg and didn't need to. Illuminator's owners Francois Carruthers and Ian Robinson are staunch supporters of Cape racing so were thoroughly deserving winners.

The German automaker, whose brands include Audi, Porsche and Seat as well as the core Volkswagen marque, has been hit by fallout from the diesel emissions-cheating scandal that erupted in mid-September in the U.S. and then spread worldwide. The company said it delivered 833,700 vehicles worldwide last month, down from 852,900 in November 2014. While U.S. sales were off 15.3 percent at 45,300 units, and there were steeper drops in Brazil and Russia amid unrelated economic troubles, deliveries in western Europe were up 2.6 percent at 270,400 and sales in China rose 5.5 percent to 329,000. Unlike in the U.S., there has been no confirmation Volkswagen cheated on European emissions tests. It will nevertheless recall some 8.5 million cars across the region to fix their emissions systems. For the year's first 11 months, group deliveries fell 1.7 percent to nearly 9.1 million from the previous year's 9.26 million. The company didn't give a breakdown for sales of vehicles with diesel and gasoline engines. CEO Matthias Mueller acknowledged that \"the Volkswagen Group and its brands are currently experiencing challenging times.\" \"At the same time, we are pleased that our customers are remaining loyal to us, especially in this situation, and continue to place their trust in us,\" he said in a statement. The core Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand saw deliveries drop 2.4 percent to 496,100 vehicles in November, while January-November sales were down 4.5 percent to some 5.34 million. The brand delivered 6.12 million cars in total last year. VW brand sales executive Juergen Stackmann noted the drop through November and said: \"in view of the situation of the brand, which is currently challenging, I do not expect that we will be able to compensate for this fall in the remaining days of the year.\"","label":0}

Ghosn, who is also Renault's chief executive officer, said the European market was growing at six percent so far this year -- the best since the 2007 crisis. \"I'm expecting in 2015 this recovery to continue,\" Ghosn told journalists on  the sidelines of an industry forum in China's commercial hub Shanghai. \"I don't see another six percent increase. I think the increase will probably be more moderate than six percent... in line with GDP (gross domestic product) growth,\" he said, but gave no estimates for Renault alone. Ghosn is also president and chief executive officer of Japan's Nissan Motor Co. through an alliance between the companies. Many foreign carmakers turned to China, the world's largest auto market, in the wake of the global crisis as their home markets in the United States or Europe collapsed. China's auto market is now slowing as well, as weaker domestic economic growth and a corruption crackdown take their toll. But Ghosn said Renault and Nissan were committed to adding production in China. In late 2013, Renault signed an agreement with Chinese company Dongfeng to set up a joint venture that will start production in 2016 with initial capacity  of 150,000 vehicles a year. Nissan has an existing partnership with state-backed Dongfeng, China's second largest automaker. The two companies last month announced they plan to produce Infiniti luxury cars along with their current offerings. \"We're adding capacity (in China),\" Ghosn told business executives after a speech at the China Europe International Business School. \"We don't believe the slowdown in China is going to be long-term because the  fundamentals are still pointing towards a very good development of the industry,\" he said. China's auto sales rose just 2.5 percent year-on-year in September, the slowest growth for any month this year, to 1.98 million vehicles.

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in June, dropped 62 cents to 50.30 dollars per barrel in early deals. In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in June gained 14 cents to 51.23 dollars per barrel. Traders focused on the weekly snapshot of US crude inventories, set for release on Wednesday. \"The market is now focusing on tomorrow's US inventory numbers to dictate the next (price) movement,\" analysts at the Sucden brokerage firm said. But the trend for oil prices remained downwards. \"Rising inventory, a very weak price structure and concerns that  a significant slowdown in US growth is under way all suggest that price levels should continue to trend lower for the time being,\" said Barclays Capital analyst Kevin Norrish. With London markets closed on Monday for a public holiday, many market players were absent and low volume accentuated the movements.

But his world was soon to fall apart when he was among a group of Zambian players arrested convicted of match-fixing \u2013 and it resulted in a two-year ban by world governing body Fifa. \"Wilson Raj Perumal is the match-fixer who approached me,\" Mweetwa said in an interview with the BBC. \"He (Perumal) was eventually arrested in Finland trying to fix matches. \"He had papers showing that he was a licensed Fifa agent. \"I do not know if he forged those papers, but he had a licence showing that he was a Fifa agent.\" \"He approached my friends and started giving them money under the guise of being an agent. \"He spent about one or two years flashing money and saying 'I like the way you play', without me realising he was a match-fixer wanting me to work for him in return. \"I was also approached, he gave me about 10,000 Euros and gave me more over time, saying he was happy with the way I was playing because I was a big name in my town where I was playing.\" Perumal eventually managed to recruit Mweetwa, and that was the beginning of the end. \"I was getting the money and enjoying it, and partying, but eventually reality dawned on me,\" said Mweetwa. \"He said the money was not for free. You need to start doing this; the money was good so I never thought it was bad to start fixing the games. \"The sad part is I was caught (arrested) on the field of play. \"We were training at the gym in the morning and then, from the gym, we went on the field of play and the police came. They had to close all the exit doors and they picked me up.\" Mweetwa is hoping that by relating his experiences he can caution others against match-fixing. \"We will tour the country (Zambia) and we are trying to get the athletes from the grassroots level to be of good character. \"We want to integrate skill and talent with integrity into athletes so that when they become successful their good character will sustain them. \"Africa is a poverty-stricken continent, we are not privileged enough as other continents like Europe and America, but we cannot just say because of poverty that is why we behave unethically. \"We are trying to make people understand that you can actually live with a true conscience and make it in life.\" \u2013 African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Herman Gibbs","label":0}

The Bulls drew their match in Auckland 22-22 with the Blues thanks to a tenacious second-half fightback, while the Sharks' playoff hopes were dealt a blow as a result of their 30-17 defeat to the Hurricanes in Durban. Meanwhile, the Jaguares consolidated their top spot in the South African Conference courtesy of a 34-23 win over the Reds in Brisbane, to push their tally to 41 points from nine wins in 14 games. The Lions are second on 35 and they are followed by the Bulls (34), Sharks (33) and Stormers (30). Lions win boost their playoff hopes The Lions kept their playoff hopes alive by beating local rivals Stormers 41-22 in a fast-paced local derby in Johannesburg on Saturday evening \u2013 their first win over a South African team this year. The Highvelders had a slender 13-10 lead at the interval but they accelerated their efforts in the second half to post a very comfortable home victory in the end. The Lions' victory came off the back of a brilliant second-half display, during which they scored four of their six tries for a well-deserved win. Kwagga Smith (2), Andries Coetzee, Courtnall Skosan, Aphiwe Dyantyi and Hacjivah Dayimani crossed the chalk while Shaun Reynolds (flyhalf) kicked four conversions and one penalty goal. Smith was a menace in open play and his sterling efforts were rewarded with two well-taken tries, while Malcolm Marx once more led from the front by putting in a great shift. Johan du Toit (flank), deputizing for his injured Springbok brother Pieter-Steph, scored his maiden Super Rugby try for the Cape side, while Herschel Jantjies (scrumhalf) and Josh Stander (flyhalf) were the other two try scorers. Stander also slotted two conversions and hit the mark with one penalty goal. The two teams were closely matched in a tight first half when the Stormers managed to keep the deficit to just three points between them. However, a brilliant passage of play in the first 17 minutes of the second half, when they managed to score three well-executed tries, sealed the match for the Highvelders. The Lions host the Hurricanes next weekend at Airline Park, while the Stormers return to Cape Town where they will host the Sunwolves in the Saturday late afternoon clash. Scorers: Lions 41 (13): Tries: Kwagga Smith (2), Andries Coetzee, Courtnall Skosan, Aphiwe Dyantyi, Hacjivah Dayimani. Conversions: Shaun Reynolds (4). Penalty goal: Reynolds. Stormers 22 (10): Tries: Johan du Toit, Herschel Jantjies, Josh Stander. Conversions: Stander (2). Penalty goal: Stander. Hurricanes tame Sharks in Durban The Hurricanes may have finished their Super Rugby clash against the Sharks with 14 men, but they still managed to comfortably beat the KwaZulu-Natalians by 30-17 in Durban on Saturday afternoon. The Durbanites trailed 20-10 at halftime in what was their last home game of the regular season fixtures list. The Kiwis scored three tries, two conversions and three penalty goals, while the home team replied with two tries, two conversions and a penalty goal. The 'Canes made a bright start and managed to score two converted first-half tries, by Jordie Barrett (fullback) and Ngani Laumape (inside centre), while Beauden Barrett (flyhalf) added two penalty goals to give them the lead at the break. Sharks fullback Aphelele Fassi scored the home team's only try, on the stroke of halftime, which was converted by Curwin Bosch (flyhalf), who also succeeded with a penalty goal. The Sharks' replacement prop Juan Schoeman gave them a great start to the second half when he scooped up the ball from a ruck following a strong run by Louis Schreuder, to score their second converted try of the afternoon, which brought the home team to within three points of the Hurricanes (20-17). But that was the closest the Sharks came to taking the lead and when Barrett added another penalty goal, and Wes Goosen (right wing) scored a well-executed try, the 'Canes took the game away from the home side. While the Hurricanes defended well and were clinical whenever they created scoring opportunities, the Sharks, unfortunately, let themselves down by committing several unforced errors. They also failed to capitalise on a numerical advantage on the field after Hurricanes flank Vaea Fifita was shown a red card five minutes from the end for a dangerous tackle. The Sharks face the Jaguares in Buenos Aires next Saturday and then conclude their regulation fixtures two weeks later against the Stormers in Cape Town. Scorers: Sharks 17 (10): Tries: Aphelele Fassi, Juan Schoeman. Conversions: Curwin Bosch (2). Penalty goal: Bosch. Hurricanes 30 (20): Tries: Jordie Barrett, Ngani Laumape, Wes Goosen. Conversions: Beauden Barrett (3). Penalty goals: Barrett (3). Tenacious Bulls fight back for draw in Auckland The Bulls fought back courageously to earn a credible 22-22 draw against the Blues in their Super Rugby match at Eden Park in Auckland on Friday. The Kiwi side held a slender 10-8 lead at halftime and although they were behind for most of the second half, the Bulls never gave up. Considering the fact that the men from Pretoria played without the experienced Springbok duo of Handre Pollard and Duane Vermeulen, and a heavy downpour that made handling very difficult, then this will be considered as a very good result for them. The Blues had a great opportunity to snatch the win right at the end of the play when Bulls wing Cornal Hendricks was penalised for a high tackle. Hendricks must have been a very relieved man when he saw how Blues flyhalf Harry Plummer's sent his penalty attempt well wide. Although not quite the win they were hoping for, the two points they earned in very difficult conditions will come as a welcome boost for the Bulls, whose last success in New Zealand was in 2013 against the Blues at the same ground. The Auckland outfit went into the halftime lead with a two-point advantage following a try and penalty goal on both sides. Ofa Tuungafasi scored a converted try for the Blues in reply to the opening try of the match scored by Bulls flank Hanro Liebenberg. Plummer slotted a penalty goal in addition to the conversion, while Manie Libbok (flyhalf) also slotted a penalty goal for the visitors. The second half saw much more open play despite the difficult playing Blues lock forward Scott Scrafton barged his way over the whitewash just five minutes after the break, but a few minutes later the men from Pretoria hit back with their second try of the match to level matters on the scoreboard. Hendriks capitalised on a turnover to score in the corner following a lovely-weighted grubber kick, while Libbok did brilliantly to succeed with the difficult conversion kick. The two teams continued with their attacking intent and it was the Blues who managed to score their third try through their No 8 Akira Ioane who powered his way over the line from a Blues scrum. Plummer added the extra two points to hand the home side the lead at 22-15 with about 15 minutes to go. However, the visitors refused to give up and were rewarded for their fighting effort when the fleet-footed Libbok waltzed over untouched for their third try. He levelled matters at 22-22 with the conversion. With just a few seconds remaining on the clock, and over-eager Hendricks was penalised for a high tackle. However, Plummer pulled his penalty kick wide and the match ended in a stalemate. The Bulls conclude their Australasian tour next Friday when they tackle the Highlanders in Dunedin. Scorers: Blues 22 (10): Tries: Ofa Tuungafasi, Scott Scrafton, Akira Ioane. Conversions: Harry Plummer (2). Penalty goal: Plummer. Bulls 22 (8): Tries: Hanro Liebenberg, Cornal Hendricks, Manie Libbok. Conversions: Libbok (2). Penalty goal: Libbok.

This emerged at the organisation's National Gender Conference in  Johannesburg which ended on Wednesday. The conference found the unemployment rate for women as a whole stood at 50 percent compared  to 34 percent for men. As many as 75 percent of black women in South Africa under the age of 30 were looking for work. Cosatu's secretary general Zwelinzima Vavi said part of the reason for high unemployment among women was a virtual freeze on appointments in the public service since 1994. \"For decades nursing and teaching were almost the only way African women could gain a professional career. But this career path has been largely closed for almost ten years. As a result only  six percent of African women under 30 have professional jobs.\" Vavi said some women were confronted by a range of problems including having to travel long distances to get water and having to care for those with HIV\/Aids. However, he said Cosatu would be pressing for agreements made at  the recent Growth and Development Summit on poverty alleviation and  job creation to be carried out. \"The agreement on expanded public works including community services such as child care and sectoral strategies are critical to  generate more employment,\" said Vavi. A statement issued by Cosatu said the conference found there was  still much discrimination in the workplace and in the labour movement against working women. \"Generally, leadership is still male-dominated even in unions where women are in the majority. Conference therefore reaffirmed the resolution for quotas to be set for all levels of leadership.\" The statement said current legislation was intended to give women more equality in the workplace, and Cosatu supported this. \"Conference thus adopted resolutions to intensify our struggles to change the workplace starting with a gender-sensitive collective  bargaining strategy.\" The conference noted that while there had been great improvements in the quality of life for many people since the 1994 elections in the provision of basic services, access to democratic principles and rights and more enlightened labour policies, not all  was well on the horizon. \"Democracy has brought real gains to workers, including African women. However these gains are now under threat because of rising unemployment and the spread of HIV\/Aids. Discrimination against women is still a problem in our country, including the workplace. Conference therefore urged Cosatu to intensify its campaign for an alternative economic strategy.\" Sapa","label":0}

TWO ATTACKS ON ONE DAY The first attack occurred at approximately 20:45 p.m. local time (2045 GMT) on Tuesday, targeting the camp of a convoy UN peacekeeping mission in the West African country, Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). In the attack, a UN peacekeeper was killed by rockets and mortars, and more than 10 people were wounded, according to a statement from the convoy of the MINUSMA. The MINUSMA added that three people were severely injured, while more than 10 members of MINUSMA including civilians were lightly wounded and have received the necessary medical care. The statement also said that part of container houses were destroyed during the attack and property damage is under evaluation. The UN convoy has dispatched helicopters to carry out air guarding and a rapid reaction force to patrol the city. China's Embassy in Mali confirmed on Wednesday that a Chinese peacekeeper was killed in the attack on the camp and four other Chinese peacekeepers were injured, while China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day strongly condemned the attack on the UN peacekeepers. The second attack on a UN de-mining unit killed two Malian security guards and an international expert, the MINUSMA said in the same statement, without revealing the nationality of the expert. In a latest development, the North African branch of the al-Qaida claimed responsibility for the latest attack in Gao on social media, according to SITE Intelligence Group, a monitoring firm, on Wednesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China has urged the Mali government and the United Nations to investigate the attack and bring the perpetrators to justice.8 \"This is a grave and intolerable crime. China strongly condemns it,\" she told a daily news briefing, describing the incident as a terrorist attack on the UN peacekeeping mission. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said attacks targeting peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law, calling for swift action to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice. DEADLIEST PEACEKEEPING MISSION Since its inception in 2013, the UN mission in Mali has already lost more than 60 lives so far, making it the UN's deadliest active mission. The last month alone has seen three attacks on members of the mission. A recent attack in central Mali killed five Togolese peacekeepers on Sunday, who were traveling in the Mopti region when their vehicle came under fire before hitting a landmine. In 2012, Mali was thrown into chaos when several insurgent groups in the north began a war against the Malian government for independence. The landlocked country suffered from further conflicts and bloodshed when President Amadou Toumani Toure was ousted in a coup over his handling of the crisis. The MINUSMA was established in 2013 to support the country's reconciliation between the north and south and carry out security-related tasks. However, with many armed groups active in the country, the security situation in the country is still grave. Enditem","label":1}

Neves is on a four-day official visit in South Africa. His country forms part of a group of Portuguese-speaking and African countries seeking to mediate a return to legality in Sao Tome.

The bloodless coup has been strongly condemned by the African Union, which vowed not to recognise the new regime. Sao Tome's military junta and the mediators were to resume talks  on Monday. Neves reported that the junta leaders showed \"great openness to dialogue\". This was underlined by their agreement to free the detained Sao Tome leaders. \"They also wish to give power back to the democratic institutions that exist.\" Events after the coup showed how useful the AU could be.

The Commerce Department said that spending rose by just 0.4 percent last month after a 0.7 percent gain in April. Income growth  also slowed to an advance of just 0.4 percent last month, reflecting weaker job growth. The report on personal incomes and consumer spending provided further evidence that the U.S. economy, after growing strongly in the first three months of the year, slowed sharply in the spring as  Americans were battered by rising gasoline prices, higher interest rates and a cooling housing market. The government reported Thursday that the overall economy raced ahead at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the January-March quarter, the fastest pace in 2 1\/2 years. But analysts believe growth has slowed to just half that amount in the current April-June quarter reflecting a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity. Inflation, as measured by a price gauge tied to consumer spending, rose by 0.4 percent in May and was up 0.2 percent when energy and food prices are excluded. This measure of core inflation  is up 2.1 percent when compared to May 2005, slightly above the Fed's upper bounds for core inflation of 2 percent. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke sent stocks plunging in early June when he cited an increase in core inflation as an \"unwelcome\" development, raising worries that the Fed was going to increase interest rates several more times to fight inflation. The Fed did boost its federal funds rate on Thursday for a 17th time to 5.25 percent, but Wall Street posted a strong rally on the wording of the Fed statement, which indicated future rate increases  would be dependent on incoming data. The 0.4 percent increase in consumer spending in May, which was in line with Wall Street expectations, was the slowest increase in three months. Excluding price increases, spending was up an even weaker 0.1 percent in May, down from a 0.2 percent rise in inflation-adjusted spending in April. Sapa-AP","label":0}

The functions of the commission would be expanded to ensure it better served workers, said chief director of collective bargaining Thembinkosi Mkalipi. For example, illiterate people would have their dispute forms filled out for  them. Many poor workers did not have access to facilities such as fax machines,  which were needed in the resolution of issues. Mkalipi said the CCMA would be required to provide these services under the proposed legislation. Employers frequently applied to the courts for reviews of CCMA rulings. This  should be the exception, rather than the rule, he said. In future businesses would be required to give money to the courts as security, and the labour court should resolve each matter within six months. \"If you've got a strong case, you must be prepared to put your money where your mouth is,\" Mkalipi said. \"Remember, the poor worker isn't getting paid.\"  Under the amendment bills, the CCMA would no longer entertain claims of unfair dismissal from high income earners \"unless you can come up with issues that are automatically unfair, like racism\", he said. The minister would decide what threshold would determine \"high income\", but it was expected to be around R1 million per year. The amendments would also protect workers through tightening up law around labour brokering, he said. Temporary work would be defined as work that lasted no more than six months,  said Mkalipi. \"After six months, I cannot be treated differently from other employees, no matter if I am employed by the broker or the client,\" he said. \"Let's give workers what is due to them.\"  This could be summarised as \"same treatment and same pay for the same work\". Exceptions included workers who earned more than R172,000 per year, certain types of seasonal work and contracts to replace staff on sick leave. For high income earners, the CCMA will not consider claims of unfair dismissal -- if  the worker is given a fair notice period Despite pressure from labour unions, Mkalipi said that the department saw greater value in regulating labour brokers through law, rather than abolishing them. Dumisani Dakile of the Congress of SA Trade Unions said labour was \"highly disappointed\" that brokering was not outlawed in the bills. \"Slavery was far better than labour brokering,\" he said in question time. The purpose of the briefing was to inform the public about the amendments to  the Labour Relations Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. Briefings would be held across the country until the end of April. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant submitted the bills to the Cabinet Committee on March 14, and their submission to Parliament was approved the following week. Mkalipi said Parliament could put the bills up for further public hearings, but the department had conducted these in 2010 and would not make further changes. Sapa  \/mjs\/gj\/dd\/ks","label":0}

Indeed, she recalled that the international tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia were reminders that persistence and determination could result in the arrest and surrender of suspects many years after the issuance of arrest warrants. The Court was established by the treaty known as the Rome Statute, adopted at an international conference in Rome on July 17, 1998. It entered into force on July 1, 2002. \"The States that form this Council have the power, independently and collectively, to positively influence and incentivise States, whether or not parties to the Rome Statute, to assist in the efforts to arrest and surrender the Darfur suspects,\" she said, adding that regional organisations could do the same. The prosecutor said there had been alleged cases of non-compliance by the parties to the treaty. She said a pre-trial chamber of the Court planned to decide whether South Africa acted in non-compliance with the Statute when it failed to arrest and surrender Al Bashir in June 2015. Most recently, Al Bashir travelled to Jordan on March 29, but Jordan declined to arrest and surrender him. \"Inviting, facilitating or supporting the international travel of any person subject to an ICC arrest warrant is inconsistent with a commitment to international criminal justice,\" she said. \"It is also an affront to the victims in the Darfur situation.\" Bensouda noted that to date, the Court had made 13 decisions on non-compliance and referred them to the Security Council. \"Yet not one has been acted upon by this Council,\" she said. \"By failing to act in response to such Court decisions,this Council is in essence relinquishing and undermining its clear role on such matters\" arising from the Rome Statute and the Council's resolution 1593 (2005), which referred the Darfur situation to the body. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The latter part of the meeting was an extended Cabinet meeting which was joined by Premiers and Members of the Executive Committees (MEC's) responsible for Finance. The purpose of the extended meeting was to receive a presentation on the results of the Community Survey and to discuss the macro-economic outlook, the Medium Term Strategic and Expenditure Framework, and the Division of Revenue Framework for the 2008\/9 financial year.  All Members of Cabinet, including President Mbeki and the Deputy President, attended the meeting wearing either a Springbok supporter's jersey, jacket, scarf or cap and Springbok flags were displayed at the main entrance and in different parts of the Cabinet room. A DVD of photos of the Rugby World Cup final was playing in the background during the meeting. In this way, Cabinet was expressing its support for  the Bokke for winning the Rugby World Cup.  Cabinet joins the millions of South Africans in congratulating the Springboks for winning the IRB Rugby World Cup and bringing the Web Ellis trophy home. This victory has helped to establish our country as a sporting nation that is capable of competing with and winning against  the best in the world. Our congratulations go to the staff and management of the team and most of all, to all the players for showing resilience, commitment, dedication and passion throughout the tournament and particularly during the final on Saturday evening. With the titles of Coach of the Tear, Team of the year, Player of the year all coming home with the Bokke, we can truly say that South Africa is indeed the home of champions.  The Springbok's victory is, and will be for many years to come, an inspiration to millions of young, talented, sport-loving South Africans  and it will also serve to inspire our soccer fraternity to double their  efforts to give South Africans another reason to celebrate in the 2010 FIFA WORLD CUP. In the same vein, we congratulate the Bafana Bafana for  winning the COSAFA Cup last night.  The meeting also conveyed a special THANK YOU to all South Africans for supporting and standing behind the team throughout the tournament. Cabinet calls on South Africans to show their full support to the Springboks by turning out in their millions during the planned processions in the various cities around the country. This support must  also translate into active support to all our national sports teams as we move closer to achieving the goal of building non-racial sports.  This victory demonstrates the role that sports can play in uniting all South Africans and getting everyone to focus on the positive things  that make our nation great. There is no reason why South Africans cannot channel this positive energy and unity towards tackling all the challenges that face our young democracy.  The President announced at the meeting that he will receive the Springboks on Friday at the Union Buildings at 09h30 to mark the beginning of their national tour to take the Web Ellis trophy to the various cities around the country.  Cabinet resolved to suspend wild abalone (also known as perlemoen) fishing with effect from the 1st November 2007, and approved a social plan to address the job losses that would result from this decision. This suspension was based on the fact that the abalone stock is in a crisis and is threatened with commercial extinction. The main causes of  the decline in abalone stocks are poaching and the migration of West Coast Rock Lobsters into the abalone areas which consume Sea Urchins that provide shelter to juvenile abalone. Later this morning, the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism will release a statement giving further details in this regard. Some of the measures incorporated in the Social Plan will include the development of a sustainable aqua-culture industry and issuing of additional permits for  whale watching","label":0}

David Mamuleka has sold beverages and snacks there since Friday. \"My stall has been making a lot of money. I am very grateful for that,\" he said. Mandela moved into the house with his first wife Evelyn Mase in 1946, according to the website www.mandelahouse.co.za. They divorced in 1957, and a year later he was joined there by his second wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. He spent a brief time in the house after his release from prison in 1990. It  is now a museum and national monument. Mandela died at his home in Houghton, Johannesburg, on Thursday night at the  age of 95.  A man living a street away from the house in Vilakazi Street said on Monday that she had fond memories of Mandela. \"My mother and I met Madiba when he was campaigning for the ANC after he was  released from prison,\" said Xolani Khoba, who lives in Lembede Street. \"He came into our house to ask us how we are and said that he wanted to help  the community improve their living conditions. \"It was such a blessing seeing the thousands of people coming to pay their respects to Tata.\" Sapa \/kd\/jk\/cls\/jje","label":0}

Ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  meet Monday in Vienna to discuss ways of stabilizing the market after Hurricane Katrina drove prices to new highs - including possibly raising the group's production ceiling by 2 percent. The group is widely expected to increase the production ceiling by 500,000 barrels a day. But previous OPEC moves have done little to ease market fears over supply, and any increase is widely regarded as meaningless because it merely sanctions existing production. Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Ali Naimi has said he supports a ceiling hike, but that he also did not see demand for more crude. He did not specify the size of the increase. \"We'll listen to the Saudi proposal but we shouldn't increase just for increase's sake,\" al-Attiyah said Sunday in Doha, Qatar. Al-Attiyah said the problems with U.S. refineries being offline since Katrina hit were temporary, but the capacity \"will take a few  months to get back to full production.\" \"If there's no demand, how will that affect prices?\" he said. OPEC President Sheik Ahmed Fahd Al Ahmed Al Sabah said in comments published Sunday that he supported an increase in production quotas, despite fears about a glut. \"There are fears in the oil markets of supplying the markets with crude despite the existence of a large surplus,\" he said in remarks published by the Kuwaiti daily Al-Rai Al-Aam. \"There are quantities that the markets can't absorb and that don't have a buyer,\" said Al Sabah, who is also Kuwait's oil minister. However, he reiterated that OPEC will try to stabilize prices. \"We will do whatever we can at this meeting, including suggesting a 500,000 barrel-a-day increase,\" he said. With oil prices about 50 percent higher than a year ago and motorists feeling the increase at the gas pump, the ministers have repeatedly said that OPEC is concerned and are doing all they can to keep the market well-supplied and prices stable. But concern that high prices have weakened oil demand has dampened prices, which had soared above US{dollar}70 a barrel on concern about production outages caused by Hurricane Katrina, instability in Iraq and the upcoming winter season. Prices hit their lowest levels in five weeks Friday, with light,  sweet crude for October closing at US{dollar}63 on the New York Mercantile  Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Aug. 5. Gasoline closed  at US{dollar}1.7851 a gallon, the lowest close since Aug. 3. There appears to be increasing volumes of unsold heavy, sour crude that the U.S. doesn't need, creating a dilemma for OPEC - the  group must appear to be doing all it can to alleviate the pain consumers are feeling, while risking sharper crude price declines from the backwash of crude caused in part by Katrina. Adding to international pressure on OPEC, the European Commission said European Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs will meet Al Sabah on Sunday to discuss high oil prices and their effects on the European economy. Katrina slammed into the U.S. Gulf Coast, a major oil production  hub, at a time when producers worldwide were already struggling to cope. The storm was blamed for the evacuation of more than 700 offshore platforms and rigs. Several Gulf Coast refineries in Katrina's path have shut down or reduced operations. In response, the International Energy Agency this month agreed to release 2 million barrels a day of crude oil, gasoline and other  fuels on to the world market from their strategic stockpiles over the ensuing 30 days. That is equal to about 2.4 percent of the world's daily fuel consumption. Sapa-AP","label":0}

Violence marred the first round of elections in July, which erupted in the capital Kinshasa between supporters of presidential frontrunners Joseph Kabila and Jean-Pierre Bemba, killing 23 people. \"Since the beginning of the election campaign, numerous reports received by the human rights division show a worrying increase in the number of violent incidents or political intolerance,\" said Fernando Castanon, head of the human rights division of the UN mission,(MONUC). Castanon said the violence occurred in four different cities in the vast country - but not in Kinshasa - between rival supporters of the two presidential candidates, leaving about 10 people injured. Rival groups tore down banners of the opposing camp and one armed group destroyed an antenna at a television station in the  southern town of Lubumbashi, Castanon said.

With the May 12 record finish of 5,364.5 in sight, the benchmark  SP\/ASX200 ended the week to October 13 at 5,290.0, up 69.3 points or 1.33 percent on the previous week's 5,220.7. \"The May record high is now within easy reach, just a few days trading away, and the ASX 200 is likely to reach 5,500.0 points by year end,\" AMP head of investment strategy and chief economist Shane Oliver said. The global economy appeared on track for a soft landing, the inflation and interest rate threat was gradually receding, and the world is awash in excess savings looking for a home and shares remain good value, he said. However, the Reserve Bank of Australia's relatively more aggressive stance on Australian interest rates and softness in commodity prices as global growth slows may constrain the performance of Australian shares in the short-term, Oliver said. He said the forward price-earnings ratios for global shares and Australian shares was still around or below their 2003 bear market lows, while Australian shares were trading on a forward PE of 13.8 times compared to an average over the last 10 years of 15.1 times. Meanwhile, CommSec chief equities economist Craig James said his  firm expected the benchmark ASX 200 index to end the year at around  5,350.0 points, up 100 points on their previous forecast. \"The combination of attractive valuations and increased takeover  activity -- especially in the media and financials sectors -- means  that the sharemarket is now likely to be testing record levels in the first quarter of 2007,\" James said.

Although the United States has refused to make any firm troop commitments for a peacekeeping force in Liberia, Bush said his administration is still debating how Washington can logistically help create the new mission. \"I told the Secretary-General that we want to help, and there must be a UN presence, quickly, in Liberia,\" he said. Bush also said that he discussed how long it would take for UN \"blue-helmeted\" troops to arrive in Liberia. \"We would not be blue-helmeted. We would be there to facilitate - and then to leave,\" he said. The Secretary-General has described the situation in Liberia as \"deplorable\", with a million people trapped in Monrovia, and with 80 percent of the country inaccessible. Liberia's humanitarian needs were \"very serious\", Annan said, adding that the country was also facing serious human rights abuses. \"I think whatever we can do to help the Liberian situation will be appreciated by millions, not just in Liberia, but also around the continent,\" he added. Annan said that with the arrival of a vanguard Ecowas force, Taylor has promised to leave Liberia. \"And then the force will be strengthened, hopefully, with US participation, and additional troops from the West African region,\" he added. Eventually, UN blue helmets will be sent to stabilise the situation, along the lines of the UN peacekeeping mission in Sierra  Leone. \"Once the situation is calmer and stabilised, the US would leave and UN peacekeepers would carry on,\" Annan said. After a closed-door meeting Monday, Ambassador Inocencio Arias of Spain, president of the 15-member Security Council, told reporters that the Council had agreed to \"respond quickly\" to Annan's proposal last week for a reduction of the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (Unamsil). The 13,000-strong Unamsil, currently the largest single UN peacekeeping force, is to be gradually phased out, with a view to a  complete shutdown by December next year. Annan has said that if the security situation continues to improve in Sierra Leone, Unamsil will close shop as early as June next year. The peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone has cost the United Nations over 500 million dollars annually. After a five-year civil war that killed more than 10,000 people and displaced several hundred thousand, a democratically elected government under President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah signed a peace treaty  with the rebel group Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in November 1996.  In May 1997, however, Kabbah was ousted in a military coup, but was restored to power in March 1998 with the help of a regional African peacekeeping force, the Economic Community of West African States Monitor","label":0}

Examination quality controlling body Umalusi announced on Thursday that it had found evidence of cheating at 10 Mpumalanga schools. It directed that the matric marks of more than 2300 pupils  be withheld when the provincial results are released on Saturday. Umalusi's provisional investigation found irregularities in exams in 12 subjects -- business economics, economics, mathematics,  physical science, history, agricultural science, biology, geography, physiology, hospitality studies, compu-typing and Isizulu. It could not say how many scripts were affected. Investigators found evidence of common answers at some examination centres and of similar changes made to answers by groups of students.

You start with yourself and people in your immediate environment, the people you would easily dismiss,\" he said at a ceremony in Cape Town to celebrate winning the Templeton prize. He said it was everyone's responsibility to see the divine in others, even in the man sleeping in the street. Tutu said he had great faith in the youth being able to deliver on this aspiration. \"There is no question at all that young people know what they are looking for and almost all would say it's a spiritual thing,\" he said. \"I always say, what a pity they grow older and become more cynical.\" Citizens had to acknowledge the change which had taken place since apartheid. He said South Africa became the \"flavour of the month\" when apartheid was abolished in 1994, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up, and citizens were riding on the victory at the Rugby World Cup. \"We can't pretend we have remained at the same heights and that's why I say please, for goodness sake, recover the spirit that made us great.\" When asked where exactly the country was failing, Tutu focused on violence and inequality. \"Very simply, we are aware we've become one of the most violent societies. It's not what we were, even under apartheid,\" he said. Rape, murder, and the high number of road accidents, especially over the holiday season, were worrisome. One did not have to look at statistics to see that South Africa was one of the most unequal societies in the world, and the problem was underpinned by a lack of spirituality. \"This is why we ought to be saying it is utterly blasphemous that we should still have people who live in shacks. It's not politics, it's religion.\" The Templeton prize, worth US1.7 million (around R15 million), is awarded to  those who have contributed to \"affirming life's spiritual dimension\". Tutu did not make it clear what he would do with the money, but said: \"I will not disappoint.\" Sapa \/je\/hdw\/ks\/clh","label":0}

Breton said: \"There was a momentary slowdown in the summer which  turns out to have been a technical setback.\" Since the middle of 2005 the French economy had been driving ahead and the outlook for the fourth quarter of this year was \"good, even very good\", he said. This was largely owing to a strong international environment and  a likely surge of French exports, he told a quarterly press conference. The price of oil, at about 60.0 dollars per barrel, was \"clearly\" too high, but the economic situation in Europe, and particulalrly in Germany, \"is the best for six years\", and the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar was steadying. He also said that annual overspending on public accounts would fall to 2.5 percent of output next year from 2.7 percent this year. The national debt would fall this year to 64.6 percent of output  this year from 66.6 percent last year, and then to 63.6 percent next year. Breton said the European Union was likely to lift a so-called excessive deficit procedure against France next month because France had cut overspending to 2.9 percent of output in 2005, within the EU ceiling of 3.0 percent. The debt is the cumulation of past annual public deficits, and the high level of debt is often mentioned by political personalities as campaigning heats up for a presidentiual election in April. Breton said that the draft finance bill laid down a public deficit for 2007 of 2.5 percent and that \"this is what we are working towards: we are well on the way.\" The public deficit, under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty that created the eurozone and of the Stability and Growth Pact that  extends rules for economic convergence, define the public deficit or surplus as covering spending by central government, social budgets and local authority budgets.

They would be taken for forensic testing after 9am on Thursday, and would only then be transported to Qunu for reburial, he said. Mandela's grandson Mandla Mandela had the bodies exhumed and moved to Mvezo in 2011. He claimed that Mvezo, where he was building a multi-million rand hotel, was  the birthplace of the Mandelas and held historic significance. The graves are those of Mandela's eldest son Madiba Thembekile, who died in a car accident in 1969; Mandla Mandela's father Makgatho Mandela, who died in 2005; and Mandela's first daughter Makaziwe Mandela, who died as an infant in 1948. According to a family member, Mandla Mandela refused to answer why he had moved the graves without consulting the family and stormed out of a meeting in Qunu last week when he was ordered to return the remains. A community member took him to court last year for digging up community graves to build the hotel. The case has yet to be heard. However, the Eastern Cape High Court granted members of the Mandela family, led by Mandela's eldest daughter Makaziwe, an order on Friday, compelling Mandla Mandela to return the remains to Qunu. He challenged the ruling, but lost. Judge Lusindiso Pakade found on Wednesday that his actions were \"scandalous\"  and \"vicious\" and ordered the sheriff of the court to exhume the graves in Mvezo and move them to the family farm in Qunu. Mandla Mandela challenged this ruling too, and lost again. A second judge found his application to have the judgment rescinded was \"frivolous\".  Meanwhile, the family brought criminal charges of tampering with a grave against Mandla Mandela. \"The investigation started yesterday Tuesday after the case was opened,\" said Fatyela. He said the charge was laid by members of the Mandela family, but he would not name them. Late on Wednesday afternoon, an official in the sheriff's office used a pickaxe to break open the gate to the Mvezo Village, allowing three hearses and  police vans to enter. With them were Makaziwe Mandela and her grandson Ndaba Mandela. Health officials started digging for the remains, and had found them by early evening. Nelson Mandela remained critically ill on Wednesday in a Pretoria hospital, where he is being treated for a recurring lung infection. Sapa \/gq\/clh","label":0}

Experienced Chippa midfielder Mark Mayambela was a thorn in the flesh of Pirates for the entire match and proved to be the architect of the opening goal in the 18th minute. The former Pirates and Ajax Cape Town man seemed to have run too far with the ball across the park, but managed to lay it off to Sizwe Mdlinzo, whose chip found Mxolisi Macuphu, who blasted the ball home. Eight minute later, Pirates managed to level matters when Bernard Morrison's attempted cross struck the arm of Chippa midfielder Paseka Mako on the right-hand side of the home team's penalty area. Morrison put the spot-kick into the back of the Chippa goal-net, just out of the reach of the host's goal-minder and ex-Buccaneer No 1 Brighton Mhlongo. Chippa should have been two goals to the good by this stage after Mdlinzo fired wide of an open goal target in the 14th minute, after the ball was cut back to him during a Chippa counter attack. Pirates thought they had taken the lead in the 58th minute when midfielder Musa Nyatama played the perfect ball through to unleash Morrison who netted, but the goal was ruled off-side. Pirates' Zambian striker Justin Shonga put the visitors ahead in the 73rd minute when he finished off an intense period of play in the Chippa goalmouth. Ten minutes later, Chippa's second half substitute Katlego Mashego levelled the score with his first touch since entering the game, as he netted after Thabo Rakhale's shot was initially blocked. However, Pirates restored the lead when defender Innocent Maela produced a superb cross from the left, which the small body frame of Thembinkosi Lorch managed to get a glancing header on, four minutes from full-time. Chippa did their utmost to find the equaliser, but were caught on a counter attack when Shonga powered home his second goal of the afternoon from the tightest of angles on the right-hand side in the 90th minute. Pirates moved to 26 points from 22 games, which places them four points behind log-leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, as they begin preparations for Saturday's Soweto Derby against fellow title-chasers Kaizer Chiefs. The result in Port Elizabeth brought an end to Chippa's seven-match unbeaten run (six in the league and one in the Nedbank Cup), as they remain on 27 points from 23 games. Their next league outing will be against high-riding Cape Town City in Cape Town on Friday. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Michael Sherman","label":0}

Panayiotou is accused of orchestrating the murder of his wife, Jayde, in April last year. It is alleged he paid a bouncer at his Infinity night club, Luthando Siyoni, to hire hitman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke to kidnap and murder Jayde. The state alleges that Sinethemba Nenembe assisted the alleged hitman Vumazonke to kidnap and kill Jayde at the behest of her husband. During a bail application based on new facts at the Port Elizabeth magistrate's court on Tuesday, Defence Advocate Terry Price, read out parts of Panayiotou's 67 page affidavit. He indicated that there were contradictions in Siyoni's statements made to police at the time of his arrest. Price accused police of \"severely beating\" a confession out of Siyoni who is now a section 204 witness. This means that the court will grant him full indemnity from prosecution if it deems his testimony honest and reliable. \"He had informed various police officers that he had been assaulted. In the statement Luthando Siyoni told Swanepoel again that he was assaulted by police officers...I'm baffled that Swanepoel did not take any of Siyoni's claims to be investigated and I'm equally surprised that he did not see that Siyoni was taken to a doctor for his injuries. It was clear that Swanepoel was more interested in pressurising Siyoni to implicate him Panayiotou,\" \"Luthando Siyoni waived his right to an attorney until he had completely implicated himself in his meeting..and then returned to the police station giving the police more than enough evidence to arrest not only me Panayiotou but himself as well,\" said Price. Price also questioned why Panayiotou's touch DNA was not found on the alleged hit money. He said the docket revealed that forensics only discovered touch DNA of Siyoni, his girlfriend Babalwa and Vumazonke. \"They could not find my DNA anywhere on that money.If I did with the money as they claim why is it that my DNA is nowhere to be found?\" I submit that this is proof that Siyoni's claim, that I gave him money in the circumstances is false beyond all doubt. It is now becoming clearer that the plot to kill Jayde, may have been a plot initiated by Siyoni himself for reasons he will only know,\" said Price. Panayiotou's affidavit further highlights that Siyoni was possibly linked to drug dealing. He indicated that the recordings of him allegedly discussing the hit on Jayde with Siyoni was meant to assist the police in that he was trying to squeeze information out of the bouncer. \"I was merely doing what police told me to do. Siyoni is the only witness who implicated me and by him doing so he escapes a life sentence..if he was not beaten, he would not implicate me..police abused the legal process..only after he implicated himself was he given a legal representative.\" According to Price, Siyoni is currently being detained at Humewood police station. Price went on to further highlight \"contradictions\" made by Siyoni in two separate police statements. Price said there was no evidence in the police docket that supported Jayde being pistol whipped on the head. He said there was no further evidence whatsoever of anyone placing Jayde in a boot of any car. \"We are unable to find where the state got any of this evidence since there is nothing like this in the docket.\" He further poked holes in the statement made by the investigating officer Kanna Swanepoel. Price questioned how Swanepoel came to the conclusion that Jayde was overspending and that Panayiotou was forced into buying a house against his will. \"Where does Swanepoel get this information from? It is clear that in the absence of anything in the docket...Swanepoel directly mislead the court into believing that I Panayiotou had a motive to have Jayde killed in that she was spending too much money and forcing me into buying a house.There is not an iota of admissible evidence anywhere in the docket supporting these defamatory claims not only about me but also about Jayde, who is anything but not a spender.\" This is Panayiotou's third bail attempt. He has been languishing at St Albans prison since his arrest last year. He was initially denied bail in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court and then again in the Grahamstown High Court where he appealed that decision. His first attempt for bail was denied by Magistrate Abigail Beeton. In her reasoning, Beeton cited that Panayiotou had an inclination to conceal or destroy evidence. On Tuesday, Panayiotou slammed police officials for having searched his house without his consent. His affidavit further highlighted that he was not given a right to an attorney at the time of his arrest. Panayiotou once again complained about the conditions at St Albans prison and said that he wanted to be able to consult with his lawyers in an air conditioned room. Price also went on to read affidavits provided by Panayiotou's parents, Costa and Fanoula. They said that they loved Jayde and would make sure their son would stand trial. \"We are committed to PE, we derive our finances from our businesses in Port Elizabeth....We mourn Jayde's death and we loved her dearly..We believe in Christopher's innocence without a doubt.\" The court heard that since Panayiotou's incarceration his businesses had been suffering in that one business had to be closed down and two properties had to be sold. The affidavit indicated that Panayiotou was not in possession of his Cypriot passport. Price also said they wanted to look at the possibility of installing an ankle bracelet on Panayiotou if he were to be granted bail.

Foreign businesses have since fled the country in droves, and foreign direct investment has plummeted. What's behind Mongolia's swift change in fortune? Ulan Bator, Mongolia (dpa) - Inside a cramped traditional tent dwelling called a ger, a formerly nomadic family sleeps and cooks around a coal stove in the polluted provincial capital of Bayankhongor. They have relied on the eldest son's military income since 2000, when a summer drought followed by a harsh winter in the central plains of Mongolia wiped out their herd of goats. \"We didn't know how to live. We turned to ninja mining but did not find any gold,\" said the mother Ariunaa Zinameder, 54, referring to the practice of digging small, unauthorized mines for gold. Since then, the family of eight has subsisted on 36 dollars worth of food stamps a month. They are part of Mongolia's increasing number of impoverished, who have not benefited from the country's resource wealth amid a steep drop in global commodity prices, stalled mining projects and domestic political disputes. Mongolia was the world's fastest-growing economy just a few years ago. Foreign direct investment fueled the boom, peaking at around 5 billion dollars in 2011, before dropping to nearly zero last year. Unemployment in Mongolia reached nearly 12 per cent this year, compared to 5 per cent in 2012. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed last year to 2.3 per cent, the weakest pace since 2009. Analysts now forecast GDP to grow at just 0.8 per cent in 2016. Marcel Venhofen, executive director of the German-Mongolian Business Association in Ulan Bator, said it is rare for foreign companies to maintain offices in Mongolia. \"Many have kept strong ties with local contacts, but the market here is too small and a lot of companies prefer to fly in and out to do business. German chemical company BASF pulled out of production here after the decline of the mining boom,\" Venhofen told dpa. Following a two-year dispute with the government, international mining company Rio Tinto finally gave approval in May for a 5.3-billion-dollar expansion of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. But experts say that will do little to improve the overall economic situation. Some see Mongolia's lackluster foreign trade as a failure in its \"third neighbour policy\" to improve relations with other countries to balance out the powerful influence of Russia and China. As a country with a population of 3 million that depends on mineral resources, some Mongolians have an uneasy attitude toward interest from foreign investors. \"A lot of investors' thinking is that Mongolia is resource-rich and we have projects ready to hand out to foreign partners. But most of the projects are controlled by the private sector. This makes it harder for the government to encourage cooperation,\" said Sanjaasuren Oyun, a prominent politician and leader of the Civil Will Party. \"In order to expand our economy, we have to export, but unlike other resource-rich countries such as Canada and Australia, we lack a track record in the mining sector and have messed up with bad decision making,\" Oyun told dpa. Part of the problem stems from the fact that Mongolia was focused on developing exploitation of coal deposits during the past few years. That backfired because of factors including climate change mitigation and China's lowered demand for coal, according to experts. \"Mongolia, like every other resource economy, might have prepared more diligently for the world commodity price downturn. Not only was the Mongolian government unprepared, it exacerbated it by policy decisions that scared foreign investment off,\" said Julian Dierkes, Mongolia expert at the University of British Columbia. Dierkes cited a series of decisions before 2012 by the then-governing Mongolian People's Party to regulate foreign investment that was seen as inhospitable to investors. Prime Minister Chimed Saikhanbileg of the Mongolian Democratic Party came to power last year promising to revive the economy through foreign investment in the mining sector. Saikhanbileg's party is expected to lose the parliamentary elections on June 29, since voters have seen no improvement in the economy. Relatively high rates of inflation over the last few years have combined with the decline of Mongolia's currency, the tugrik, leading to rising unemployment and poverty, Dierkes noted. As for Mongolia's deposits of rare earths, it would take \"five years or more to develop rare-earth extraction,\" according to Stefan Hanselmann, program director of the Integrated Mineral Resource Initiative. The country currently extracts rare-earth minerals from four larger mines, which are used as components in the manufacture of high-tech products including aircraft engines, hybrid cars and telescope lenses. \"On a world scale, however, these deposits are not regarded as very significant ones,\" said Harald Elsner, economics geologist for Germany's Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources. # Notebook ## Note to editors - Robert Schoellhammer is in his role until June 22, if published later he should be quoted as former director. ## Internet links - Germany-Mongolia trade statistics(http:\/\/dpaq.de\/BLM6U) - Julian Dierkes commentary(http:\/\/dpaq.de\/VgUxQ) - Mongolia unemployment data(http:\/\/dpaq.de\/QZT0A) - Mongolia exports data(http:\/\/dpaq.de\/3xnIu) * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Joanna Chiu (Beijing) - Editing by: Thomas Long - Tel: +66 2 714 2073; dpa jch tlo","label":0}

She was responding to media reports that prostitutes made good money during the African National Congress's election manifesto weekend in Mbombela. Vidima said prostitutes were generally too professional to expose their clients in public, but would appreciate some support towards securing their rights, a Sapa correspondent reported. \"Actually, sometimes when we go to Parliament to lobby for decriminalisation  we recognise some of the MPs as our clients.\" Sisonke, which works with the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce, is a prostitute-led movement launched in October 2003 in Worcester during a meeting of 70 prostitutes from across South Africa. Based in Hillbrow, Johannesburg, the organisation wants adult prostitutes to  be free of exploitation by police officers and shrewd pimps. \"We understand that with the elections looming no one wants to rock the boat  and risk not being re-elected into their seat,\" Vidima said. \"But the least they could do is to help us put pressure on the SA Law Reform  Commission to speed up the Sexual Offences Act 'Adult Prostitution' Law Reform Project (107),\" she said. Prostitution's criminalised status and the perception that prostitutes were too powerless to enforce their rights made them easy targets for economic exploitation. \"When an offence is committed under such laws, the proper procedure is for a  warning and then for a fine to be given, with the opportunity for the person fined to contest the charge in a court of law,\" Vidima said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Leonard Hlathi warned prostitutes not to  be proud of illegal activities. \"That they made money during the ANC event is nothing we can comment on. They should not be proud of such activities because selling sex is a crime,\" he  said. \"Police arrest them when they find them working in the streets and they are fined because it is a crime.\" Sapa \/str\/mjs\/jk\/th","label":0}

The injunction was issued by the court in April upon request of local residents over safety concerns, though the two reactors had obtained restart approval from Japan's nuclear watchdog Nuclear Regulation Authority after a safety appraisal. The restart has also been approved by the governor of Fukui prefecture, the mayor of Takahama, as well as the local prefectural assembly. The Kansai Electric Power Co. looks to restart the No. 3 reactor in January and the No. 4 in February next year, which will possibly be the 3rd and 4th reactors reactivated in Japan after two reactors at the Kyushu Electric Power Co.'s Sendai plant in resumed operations earlier this year.

The former Team of Choice striker excelled in his first full campaign as a head coach last season, marking himself down a bright up-and-coming young Premiership tactician after helping the team to a fourth-placed finish in the league, and also reaching the 2018 Nedbank Cup final. But this season has been an uphill battle for the 37-year-old Davids, who has seen his side winning only once and scoring just five goals in 14 league appearances, as they go into the Christmas break in 16th and last position. Davids' case was not helped by the departure of Lebohang Maboe to Mamelodi Sundowns and Bevan Fransman to Highlands Park, while Siphesihle Ndlovu and Andrea Fileccia have been unable to recapture the sparkling form they showed in the previous campaign. Contrary to reports in the media over the weekend, Davids was not fired after the 1-0 defeat to Baroka FC on Saturday night, as club management wanted to first arrange a sit-down to hear the coach's point of view on how the team could climb out of their predicament. Following that meeting, it was decided that the best solution would be for the two parties to go their separate ways. \"At a meeting at the Maritzburg United club offices on Monday, Chairman Farook Kadodia and head coach Fadluraghman Davids decided to amicably part ways. \"The outgoing coach has wished the club all the best in fighting our way out of the relegation zone,\" read a club statement. \"It was an uphill challenge for the coach to meet his performance target and we have currently opened discussions with a potential replacement to fill this void,\" Kadodia said. \"I would like to thank coach Fadlu for his commitment to Maritzburg United, and for taking the club to two top-eight finishes in the league, as well as the Nedbank Cup final. \"It's just unfortunate in football that things do not always work out as planned. We all decided it would be very difficult to turn the current situation around. We thank coach Fadlu for engaging with us amicably in this regard and wish him all the very best for the future.\" Maritzburg join Free State Stars, Chippa United, Black Leopards and Kaizer Chiefs in having sacked their coaches this season.

Thursday brought a mixed slate of economic news. Although reports on  same-store sales suggested some retailers are doing better than expected and the number of people filing for unemployment claims dropped last week, home foreclosures jumped in the fourth quarter to an  all-time high, according to The Mortgage Bankers Association. The European Central Bank and Bank of England, meanwhile, decided to  leave interest rates unchanged. The foreclosure data and European interest rate decisions helped push the dollar lower. Analysts believe the steadily weakening dollar is the reason oil prices have jumped to a number of new inflation-adjusted record highs this week. Crude futures offer a hedge against a falling dollar, and oil futures bought and sold in dollars are more attractive to foreign investors when the dollar is falling. Still, after a big gain, investors often sell some positions to lock  in profits, analysts said. \"I think it's profit-taking day, regardless of what the dollar is doing,\" said James Cordier, founder of OptionSellers.com, a Tampa, Florida, trading firm. Light, sweet crude for April delivery fell 53 cents to {dollar}103.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier spiking to a new record of {dollar}105.97. Prices frequently alternated between gains and losses. Keeping a floor under oil prices Thursday was an overnight rebel attack on a Colombian oil pipeline that transports 60,000 barrels of oil a day for export markets. \"The attack was in response to the Colombian military's killing of a  high ranking member of the rebel group ... during a raid into Ecuador,\"  said Addison Armstrong, director of exchange Traded Markets at TFS Energy Futures LLC in Stamford, Connecticut, in a research note. \"The Transandino Pipeline may be out of service for up to three days following the explosion.\" The attack came as traders worried about escalating tensions between  Colombia and Venezuela over Colombia's raid into Ecuador. Venezuela moved tanks and soldiers to the Colombian border. Ecuador said Monday it had sent 3,200 soldiers to its border with Colombia. In other Nymex trading, April heating oil futures fell 0.92 cent to {dollar}2.9339 a gallon, while April gasoline futures fell 3.46 cents to {dollar}2.6075 a gallon. April natural gas futures fell 0.8 cent to {dollar}9.733 per 1,000 cubic feet. The Energy Department said inventories fell by 135 billion cubic feet last week, less than analysts had expected. In London, Brent crude fell 38 cents to {dollar}101.26 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. Diesel prices jumped 1.4 cents overnight to a new record national average of {dollar}3.71 a gallon. High diesel prices are boosting prices of consumer goods, the vast majority of which are transported by the distillate fuel.  Sapa-AP","label":1}

So it's turning to an unlikely place to grow the water-chugging crop \u2014 the drought-stricken American Southwest. Almarai Co. bought land in January that roughly doubled its holdings in California's Palo Verde Valley, an area that enjoys first dibs on water from the Colorado River. The company also acquired a large tract near Vicksburg, Arizona, becoming a powerful economic force in a region that has fewer well-pumping restrictions than other parts of the state. The purchases totaling about 14,000 acres have rekindled debate over whether a patchwork of laws and court rulings in the West favors farmers too heavily, especially those who grow thirsty, low-profit crops such as alfalfa at a time when cities are urging people to take shorter showers, skip car washes and tear out grass lawns. \"It's not easy to completely grasp the business model of the Middle East, but it may not be about business at all,\" said John Szczepanski, director of the U.S. Forage Export Council. \"The primary focus is food security, and the means to that end lie in acquiring the land and resources to ensure long-term supply.\" For decades, Saudi Arabia attempted to grow its own water-intensive crops for food rather than rely on farms abroad. But it reversed that policy about eight years ago to protect scarce supplies. To further conserve water, the country has adopted bans on selected crops. This year, the kingdom will no longer produce wheat. In December, the government announced the country will stop growing green fodder, livestock feed derived from crops like alfalfa, over the next three years. Almarai already farms worldwide to make sure that weather, transportation problems or other conditions don't interrupt supplies. The expansion in the American Southwest was a \"natural progression\" in its effort to diversify supply, said Jordan Rose, an attorney for the company's Arizona unit. \"The cows feed multiple times a day, and they need to be certain that they are always able to fulfill that unwavering demand,\" she wrote. Despite the widespread drought conditions, the U.S. is attractive to water-seeking companies because it has strong legal protections for agriculture, even though the price of land is higher than in other places. \"Southern California and Arizona have good water rights. Who knows if that will change, but that's the way things are now,\" said Daniel Putnam, an agronomist at the University of California, Davis. Over the last decade, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates emerged as significant buyers of American hay as their governments moved to curb water use. Together they accounted for 10 percent of U.S. exports of alfalfa and other grasses last year. The land purchases signal that Almarai doesn't just want to buy hay; it wants to grow. And it's not the only Arab-owned Gulf company to take that approach. Al Dahra ACX Global Inc., a top U.S. hay exporter based in Bakersfield, California, is owned by Al Dahra Agriculture Co. of United Arab Emirates. It farms extensively in Southern California and Arizona and, according to its website, plans to add 7,500 acres in the United States for alfalfa and other crops. The exporter packages crops grown across the West at its two plants in California and one in Washington state. Most of the farms that Arab companies own worldwide are in developing nations. For instance, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has holdings in Latin America and Africa. But part of the kingdom's long-term food security strategy means investing in higher-cost countries with greater political stability, said John Lawton, owner of Agriculture Technology Co., a farming company in Saudi Arabia. In 2014, Almarai paid $47.5 million for more than 9,800 acres in La Paz County, Arizona, a sparsely populated alfalfa-growing region that is exempt from severe restrictions on pumping imposed on Phoenix, Tucson and other large Arizona cities under a 1980 state law designed to protect the state's aquifers. It later turned to the Palo Verde Valley, where Southern California settlers staked claim to the Colorado River in 1877, beating Los Angeles and San Diego under a Gold Rush-era doctrine called \"first in time, first in right\" that governs the 1,450-mile waterway. The company paid $31.5 million for 1,790 acres in January after buying about 2,000 acres there last year. Farmers and water experts have greeted Almarai with both cheers and jeers. Supporters note that the company has embraced water-conservation methods that few other farmers have adopted. The Arizona Department of Water Resources released maps that show well levels on Almarai's property in La Paz County rose in recent years, and the farm's footprint has remained about the same since 2000. In California, some farmers say Almarai is a well-run company that has boosted the economy by growing its own alfalfa and buying more hay from neighboring farmers. The company recently broke ground on a plant in California's Imperial Valley to package hay into ship-ready bales. Others say the purchases highlight misguided water policies. La Paz County Supervisor Holly Irwin raises concern that Almarai will deplete wells. \"We've got them coming, moving in here and using our natural resources up. Why isn't anyone paying attention to the ground we live on?\" she said. Christopher Thornberg, an economist at the University of California at Riverside, called alfalfa farms a \"shocking waste of a resource\" and suggested California consider seizing land under eminent domain. \"At some point in time,\" he said, \"we have to face the fact that the state cannot continue to prosper under the current circumstances.\" ___ Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.","label":0}

Three houses were torched as well as maize fields. \"These actions are condemned in the strongest possible terms, and as is in the murder case, the law must take its cause in the investigation of these criminal acts against the farming community,\" said Johannes Moller, president of Agri SA. \"If the accused in the murder trail are found guilty they must face the consequences of their actions. It cannot be allowed that members of society take the law into their own hands if they are not satisfied with the proceedings of a court of law, they should also face the consequences for their criminal actions.\" He called on the police to provide the necessary protection to farmers and to do a thorough investigation of the violent crime. \"This type of violence can solve no problem and can only lead to a security catastrophe unless timely action is taken by the police and community leaders...\" A group of farmers pointed protesting residents with guns when they were walking home from court, and other group of farmers attacked journalist after a farm house was looted and torched. Solidarity Movement said North West premier, Supra Mahumapelo, must accept responsibility for the vandalism that took place in Coligny. \"This is now a time for leadership to defuse the crisis and not to exploit the tragic death of a child to incite people by using racial slurs,\" said chairperson Flip Buys. This was after Mahumapelo told mourners on Sunday that Matlhomola Jonas Mosweu, 16, died at the hands of white Afrikaners. Two farmers Pieter Doorewaard, 26, and Phillip Schutte, 34, accused of his murder were granted R5000 bail and their case postponed to June 26. The move angered residents who had been protesting in front of the court against the two being granted bail. They took to the street and within minutes a farm house was on fire, two more house were set alight and road blocked. The police stood guard around a farm house in Rietvlei about 3km from town to keep youth from burning it down. The house is near the sunflower crop field where Matlhomola allegedly stole sunflower before he was caught and died after apparently falling off a moving van. Buys said Solidarity Movement was prepared to help resolve the crisis and would be pleased to have talks with the premier Mahumapelo on the process of restoring peace in Coligny. \"The situation in Coligny is serious but there is no reason to panic.

Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon told reporters that the government has a plan ready for the election if the charter is rejected, though he did not give details. His remarks echoed recent comments by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and other key officials, who have come under pressure to commit to a date after an initial draft constitution was rejected last year by the interim legislature and the promised election postponed. The government has said that criticism of the proposed new charter will be restricted, while soldiers will be deployed to explain its benefits to citizens. A new draft constitution was recently unveiled and has drawn criticism for being undemocratic and reserving too much power for the military. It is widely believed that the army is concerned about stability when the throne passes from ailing 88-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has been the constitutional monarch since 1946. The military's critics suggest it will keep its grip on power to ensure a smooth succession. Prayuth staged a coup against an elected government in May 2014 when he was army commander, saying it was necessary to restore calm because of sometimes-violent political unrest. But critics of Prayuth's junta believe it is mainly seeking to cripple one political faction, that of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by a 2006 coup. Thaksin's electoral popularity challenged the power of the country's traditional ruling class, which includes the military. The junta has generally equated criticism of its actions with incitement to unrest and instability. Asked about opposition to the draft charter, Prawit said: \"If it is 100 percent democratic and there are people protesting on the streets, that would prevent the country from moving forward. How would that be helpful? I confirm that we will have an election in the year 2017, that's for sure.\"","label":0}

The US government's Department of Energy said that the country's crude inventories climbed by 600,000 barrels last week, confirming slack consumer demand. The United States is the world's largest oil consuming nation -- and the strength of its energy demand is a key influence on the global oil market. Crude oil production in the US meanwhile averaged more than seven million barrels a day in January, the highest level since November 1992, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly report Wednesday. According to preliminary estimates, production was up by 910,000 barrels a day compared to January 2012, thanks to the development of non-conventional hydrocarbon sources including shale and tight oil reservoirs. Total US oil output increased by almost one million barrels a day in 2012, to 9.1 million barrels, according to the report. Still, the report said lower drilling levels for natural gas will result in decreased volumes of natural gas liquid (NGL). \"Though NGL production growth is expected to be muted in 2013, crude production is expected to grow by\" 610,000 barrels per day, the report said, bringing total oil output to 9.8 million barrels per day this year.

Despite her optimism this is going to be a tough assignment. Nnadozie was in goal as Nigeria lost 8-0 to France in a friendly last year, but she is adamant history won't repeat itself. \"I know they will feel relaxed and think that they will maybe score more than eight goals,\" Nnadozie. \"It's going to be a tough game. They are one of the best teams in the competition, but we are letting them know that it's not going to be like that again. \"That was last year. I know we are not going to lose. We are going to make our country proud.\" To date the World Cup has seen some superb goalkeeping performances, among them a record-breaking one from the 18-year-old Nnadozie. Nigeria entered their second match against Korea Republic under the pressure of knowing that, following a 3-0 loss to Norway, only victory would preserve realistic hope of a top-two finish in Group A. Many coaches would have played it safe, but Thomas Dennerby handed the gloves to Ndadozie and she responded with a great display in a 2-0 win. She became, at 18 years and 186 days, the youngest goalkeeper to achieve a clean sheet at the Women's World Cup. \"My coach had called me and said, 'This is your time',\" Nnadozie told FIFA.com in an interview. \"It was a dream that came true.\" Nnazodie's rise in Nigerian women's football has been rapid. She started playing football as a 12-year-old and was quickly elevated into the Under-17 and Under-20 national teams. Last year she pulled on the gloves at the Fifa Under-20 Women's World Cup and displayed her potential in a Player of the Match performance against Haiti in Brittany. It was in that tournament that Nnadozie set her sights on returning to France for the senior global finals. \"I knew it was going to come true, because when I was coming up my coach used to tell me, 'Work hard, you will get there',\" she said. \"I really worked for it. Every time at training, I gave it my best. Even if I was tired, I would keep pushing.\" Nnadozie carried only one target into France 2019. \"I told myself that before the end of the tournament, by God's grace, I must keep goal in one match,\" she said. \"When I was called upon to keep goal, though I was a little bit scared, I encouraged myself, I told myself, 'Come on, you've been doing it during the friendly matches, so you have to do it now'.\" Nnadozie achieved her pre-tournament goal in a performance against Korea Republic that demonstrated poise and maturity beyond her years. \"After the match, when I saw the post, I was so happy,\" said Nnadozie. \"A young girl like me achieving a record - I was so proud of myself. \"I am so proud of the defence. They did great. I know I can't do it without them \u2013 they made it possible for me.\" Nnadozie's chemistry with the defensive unit illustrated how quickly she has made herself a part of the Nigerian squad. The remarkable calm the teenager displays on the pitch contrasts with her infectious personality off it. \"I love playing, joking around with people,\" she said. \"Whenever I notice you are angry or sad, I will come and do some funny things. I love seeing people around me happy.\" She will be hoping to put the smiles on the faces of the whole team against France on Monday. \u2013 African News Agency (ANA) Editing by Michael Sherman","label":0}

TALK SHOW HOST SHOWS THE CHURCH HOW TO DEAL WITH SEXUAL ABUSE   A South African blogger has compared Oprah's reaction to the sexual abuse case at her South African school with the Catholic Church's reaction to revelations contained in Mario d'Offizi's book, Bless Me Father, that the late Bishop of Johannesburg and founder of Boys Town, Reginald Orsmond, sexually abused boys at his institution.  The comparison drew a defensive reaction from the Church, and sharp words from d'Offizi's publisher....  Clare van Zwieten, a South African blogger, has taken the Catholic Church to task over its lack of action around the Bishop Orsmond sexual  abuse scandal that has been a feature of the South African media landscape over the last two months.  The scandal was sparked by revelations in the autobiography of Cape Town magazine editor, Mario d'Offizi, that Orsmond sexually abused d'Offizi. These revelations were followed by letters to various papers affirming O'ffizi's story. Another ex-Boys' Town pupil (who needs to remain anonymous for legal reasons) has also come forward to state that  he was abused by Orsmond. This individual has been in contact with the church about the matter for several years.  'One certainly gets the impression that Oprah is going to leave no stone unturned, until she establishes the truth behind the allegations of assault at her school for disadvantaged girls. And this is how it should be...' writes van Zwieten.  She then goes on to contrasts Oprah's actions to the Catholic Church.  'Orsmond may have done a great deal of good work and may have inspired generations of young boys to lead better lives, but if he is guilty of having preyed on some of the young boys in his care, the Catholic Church has a moral duty to investigate properly for the sake of the alleged victims and for the sake of the church as a whole. There  have been too many scandals of this nature perpetrated and covered up by the Catholic Church authorities.'  van Zwieten's blog drew a defensive reaction from Father Chris Townsend, who has been managing the media for the Church with regard to  the Orsmond case.  \"Sometimes there is more to your story than just what you've read in  the media. The idea that the Catholic Church hopes the story will die a  natural death and that the church is involved in a cover-up are your own assertions,\" writes Townsend. \"The process of investigation and response to complaints is in place. However, no formal complaints have yet been made to the church authorities - in this case, the Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg or any other Diocesan professional Conduct Committees. The process cannot kick in if all there are are assertions in media. That Bishop Orsmond cannot respond also complicates the process... The Church is not perfect and the Church's responses are often not perfect, but to assert that the church is not doing anything is not accurate.\"  Father Townsend's response sparked a rebuttal from Ge'ko Publishing's Andrew Miller, the publisher of Bless Me Father.  \"It is quite clear when you add up the evidence that the church has known about various Orsmond allegations for many years - and yet no formal steps have ever been taken to investigate the matter,\" writes Miller, citing the interaction the church has had with the anonymous complainant and references in d'Offizi's book to allegations of abuse made several decades ago.  \"Add this allegation to O'ffizi's and the others who have written into various newspapers recently, and you have a damming collection of evidence,\" Miller continues. \"In the media the church expresses a desire to resolve and \/ or deal with such matters etc. etc. Yet d'Offizi has yet to be contacted by anyone at all regarding this matter.\" Miller goes on to say... \"As publishers, we have been in direct contact with Father Townsend, and he knows exactly how to contact Mario and investigate the matter.\"  It seems that the war of words between the Chur","label":0}

The main aim of the new regulations is to make Norway, which in 2015 saw a record 31,145 people apply for asylum, less attractive to migrants fleeing Syria and other war-torn countries, primarily in the Middle East and North Africa. The initial 150-page plan was first presented to parliament and the wider public in February. Its final version affords greater powers to law enforcement agencies to collect and store biometric information obtained from asylum applicants. Other proposals include restricting family reunions, extending the qualifying period for obtaining a permanent residence permit to five years and enabling the authorities to reject applications from asylum seekers who enter Norway through a neighboring country. The proposals immediately attracted widespread criticism, especially from the country's centrist parties, of which the Liberal Party has been the most vocal in its opposition. \"The proposals concerning restrictions on family reunification, temporary permits for unaccompanied children, as well as measures that may impede access to the asylum procedure on the Norwegian-Russian border have been evoked as particularly problematic,\" Helga Pedersen, a member of the Norwegian parliament for the Labour Party, told Sputnik ahead of Tuesday's presentation. Before Christmas, six of the eight Norwegian parliamentary parties reached an informal agreement on what kind of restrictions they believe should be introduced to the country's immigration policy, however, Listhaug's proposals are more severe than those previously outlined, the press officer of the Liberal parliamentary group, Jan Christian Kolsto, told Sputnik. \"The problem is that the package from Sylvi Listhaug went further than the agreement in the parliament... We are excited to see whether she has altered her propositions after all the criticism,\" Kolsto noted. Among other points, Sylvi Listhaug's plan for toughening asylum policies was widely criticized for lacking clear proposals for integrating asylum seekers who are accepted as refugees in Norway. \"The plan was never meant to meet the challenges of integrating immigrants,\" Kristian Larsson, communications adviser for the Progress Party, told Sputnik, rebutting this criticism. He added that this spring, Sylvi Listhaug would put forward an immigration rapport followed by proposals to parliament, specifically designed to meet the challenges of integration. Speaking ahead of Tuesday's presentation of Listhaug's final set of anti-immigrants initiatives, he expressed the Progress Party's readiness \"to fight for the bill.\" However, he wasn't sure whether the final bill would be accepted by all parties. \"Who will be in majority is naturally not known until the bill has been presented and debated,\" he concluded. Norway has estimated in its state budget that 33,000 asylum seekers would apply for asylum in the country this year.","label":0}

Romeo is among several people under investigation for suspected false property registration in one of a growing number of investigations in which mobsters are suspected of systematically buying up Roman tourist restaurants to launder cocaine profits, allegedly installing people like Romeo as figurehead owners. Romeo contended bitterly that investigators were targeting him and others merely because they are natives of Calabria, the southern region that is home to the 'ndrangheta, one of the most feared global crime syndicates. In seizing restaurants from hard-working people like himself, he said, authorities are essentially alleging that all Calabrians in Rome are crooks. He's looking forward to his day in a court so he can ask prosecutors: \"Why do you say I'm a figurehead when I paid with my own money?\" Prosecutors are confident they'll have the right answer. Along Rome's narrow Via dei Pastini, a street thronging with tourists in search of quaint restaurants, authorities raided three trattorias, including Il Barroccio, this year as alleged fronts for money-laundering operations for the 'ndrangheta. Authorities say the financially savvy 'ndrangheta is hungry for legitimate businesses to launder the billions it rakes in from cocaine trafficking. Elsewhere in Rome, the Naples-based Camorra is allegedly following a similar recipe, prosecutors say. The restaurants and cafes targeted in the probes still operate. Many are near landmarks such as Trevi Fountain and Piazza Navona. As chefs dish out pasta and waiters pour wine, anti-Mafia investigators \u2014 huddled in their offices \u2014 scrutinize tax returns and property deeds and leases. Beyond mob-owned restaurants, tourists also stand a good chance of sleeping in hotels where more than sheets are being laundered. In one case, prosecutors alleged that a convent turned into a hotel was acquired by the 'ndrangheta just in time for the 2000 Holy Year \u2014 when millions of devout pilgrims poured into Rome. \"We can seize 10 businesses a day,\" said anti-Mafia prosecutor Michele Prestipino. \"And they can buy up 10 more in a day.\" What's more, the restaurants don't suffer any hit to their business from the mafia taint, since most tourists are blissfully unaware of the probes. Romeo recounted how police roused him from sleep the morning two Via dei Pastini restaurants were seized. Two days later, the doors reopened, and tourists flocked back. That, however, hasn't been the case with the lawmakers at parliament, a short walk away from Il Barroccio. \"The politicians used to come here,\" said Romeo, his face glum. \"Now they say they can't come any more.\" While a few lawmakers might be avoiding the trattoria, Rome's status as the Italian political and administrative capital is an added attraction for the mob. \"You make connections, important friendships,\" Prestipino, the anti-Mafia prosecutor, told The AP in his Rome office. And Rome offers the right ingredients for mobsters, being hundreds of kilometers (miles) from their centuries-old power bases. \"It's a place where even conspicuous wealth blends in with other wealth,\" said Prestipino. Restaurants and hotels in Milan, Turin and other northern cities, including in the prosperous regions of Veneto and Emilia Romagna, are also becoming 'ndrangheta properties, according to Prestipino, who used to fight the 'ndrangheta on its home turf in impoverished Calabria, the toe of Italy's boot. Alfonso Sabella, a former Sicilian magistrate who battled Cosa Nostra, has urged Rome to create a mechanism to help spot anomalies like frequent ownership changes. Sabella recently served as Rome's first \"legality commissioner\" to help City Hall root out corruption and discourage infiltration by mobsters in the capital's economic fabric. The lobby group for Rome's 15,000 restaurants is alarmed by organized crime infiltration, saying that mobsters \u2014 unlike honest restaurateurs \u2014 have nearly unlimited funds to make establishments successful as eateries, not just fronts for organized crime. \"There are locales seized in the past years that were flourishing,\" Fabio Spada, president of the FIPE Confcommercio Roma lobby, told AP. \"They raked in a lot, independent of their vocation as money-launderers.\" Indeed, in recent years, organized crime has been increasingly aiming to \"make clean money from dirty money\" by investing illicit revenues into legitimate sectors of the economy, said Lt. Col. Gerardo Mastrodomenico of the organized-crime squad of Italy's tax police. The first two Via dei Pastini trattorias \u2014 La Rotonda and Er Faciolaro \u2014 were seized in March. Il Barroccio was seized in July. Money for laundering is usually moved through several often sophisticated financial channels, to make it harder for investigators to keep up with the money trail. To sniff out possible front men, accountants and other financial experts who work for a special anti-organized crime unit of Italy's tax police sift through property sale and lease records, comparing the profession and income declared on tax returns. That technique led to what so far has been the most high-profile anti-laundering seizure \u2014 the 2009 sequester of Cafe de Paris, a Via Veneto hangout made famous in \"La Dolce Vita,\" Federico Fellini's classic film. The owner on property deeds was a modestly-earning barber from a tiny hamlet in the Aspromonte mountains of Calabria, an 'ndrangheta stronghold. Fanning out from that probe, investigators checked out friends, and friends of friends \u2014 anyone who had any connections with those thought to be really running the Cafe de Paris. One man who caught investigators' attention was a Calabrian-born Rome businessman, Salvatore Lania. Intercepted phone calls indicated that he has links to suspected members of a powerful 'ndrangheta clan, said Carabinieri Col. Renato Chicoli, with a special anti-Mafia investigative unit in Rome. When police started looking into Lania's background, they found that his income tax returns declared \"almost nothing,\" Chicoli said in an interview. So how, investigators wondered, could this man suddenly start snapping up restaurants, and even a building, along pricey Via dei Pastini? Lania, 47, is being investigated for false registration of property ownership. But he isn't suspected of belonging to the 'ndrangheta, said Chicoli. According to court documents filed in connection with the first Via dei Pastini seizures, none of those under probe are suspected of actually being an organized crime member. In these documents, Romeo is described as being a \"hidden\" partner in running Er Faciolaro, while his shares are officially in the name of a brother-in-law. The court document ordering the seizure also describes Romeo as \"physically representing Salvatore Lania inside the restaurant, in running the business activity, in which he's listed as an employee.\" Lania, Romeo and more than a dozen others, including family members, are suspected of playing roles in the alleged scheme to hide the real owners of the restaurants. According to investigators, a 29-year-old Egyptian waiter and 22-year-old Ukrainian waitress agreed to be named as the owners of one restaurant, Chicoli said. Prestipino said prosecutors are likely to push for indictments soon. Romeo readily spoke of a friendship with Lania and defended him as a legitimate restaurateur who worked hard and long. \"He'd make 200 pizzas in two hours,\" Romeo said. Lania's attorney didn't return a phone call for comment. Some mobsters seem to challenge investigators to catch them. One cafe was seized down the block where Chicoli works. And anti-Mafia magistrates were among clients at some of the seized eateries. One of the pizzerias raided last year as a suspected Camorra money-laundering operation was called \"Zio Ciro\" \u2014 purportedly in homage to a reputed clan chieftain in the Naples area. For mobsters, the Rome trattoria racket can be an ego trip as well as a business investment. \"You hear it in the intercepted (phone) calls,\" said Chicoli. \"'You see this? It's our stuff.'\"","label":0}

The IFP did not want land reform policy to cause havoc in the country, IFP provincial secretary and KwaZulu-Natal premier candidate Velenkosini Hlabisa said on the sidelines of the party's final get-out-to-vote campaign \"Sizonqoba\" rally in KwaMashu, Durban. \"We do not believe in an irresponsible land distribution policy.

The drop was positive because TCRA will not change the date for switching-off the phones, Kilaba told a news conference in the east African nation's commercial capital Dar es Salaam. He attributed the achievement to the International Mobile Station Equipment Identity system (IMEI) which the country launched last December to identify counterfeit mobile phones. \"There are also ongoing awareness campaigns among the public over the importance of assessing their phones to establish whether they are original or counterfeit,\" said Kilaba. However, Kilaba said there were dishonest traders who were reducing prices of the counterfeit phones in a bid to lure customers. In March, this year, TCRA said it will soon release figures on fake mobile phone handsets now being used in the east African nation, the region's second largest economy. Innocent Mungy, TCRA communications manager, said a survey carried out in 2012 indicated that at least 38 percent of the handsets in use then were fake. Many sub-standard and counterfeit mobile phone products entered the local market illegally and that it has been difficult to control such influx, said Mungy. Enditem","label":0}

It condemns last week's nine bomb blasts in Soweto, south of Johannesburg, saying acts of sabotage cannot be condoned. The loss of a life and damage to infrastructure were equally reprehensible. A woman was killed because of one of the explosions that ripped a hole in the northern wall of a mosque in Soweto's Dhlamini area. Debris hit her shack in the Protea South informal settlement while she lay asleep. Other explosions cut railway lines between the sprawling township and Johannesburg. In its letter -- released to the media -- the Group of 63 calls for the underlying causes of these actions to be examined and addressed. \"The underlying motive ... must be sought in the constitutional powerlessness of Afrikaners in the face of the ruling majority,\" the group submits. \"Afrikaners over a wide front are experiencing that their interests are being ignored, disrespected and disadvantaged, despite their own repeated requests and petitioning to the contrary.\"  Examples include an apparent government drive to replace Afrikaans with English in education, the civil service, and the justice system. Afrikaners are also suffering because of affirmative action, rural attacks and land reform. \"Unfortunately, too, your government's policy concerning Zimbabwe has contributed greatly to Afrikaners' loss of trust in government,\" the group tells Mbeki. \"(This) has raised serious questions concerning the way in which  their interests will be dealt with in future.\" So far, Afrikaners have reacted by emigrating or withdrawing into their own private world. Some kind of settlement between Afrikaners and Africans should be found. Afrikaners do not want to return to the colonial days of minority domination. \"However, it is urgently necessary that a settlement now be attained which will provide for the equal protection of the interests of both Africans and Afrikaners,\" says the group.

(AP) \u2014 North Dakota regulators on Wednesday approved the biggest-capacity crude pipeline proposed to date that would move nearly 600,000 barrels daily from the oil patch to Illinois. Some things to know about the $3.8 billion, 1,150-mile project that crosses four states: WHAT HAPPENED? The North Dakota Public Service Commission had been reviewing Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners' permit for 13 months. The three-member, all-Republican panel long signaled support, saying the pipeline would reduce truck and oil train traffic, cut natural gas flaring and create more markets for the state's oil and gas. The commission voted 2-0 to approve the permit; Commissioner Randy Christmann abstained because his mother-in-law has been negotiating an easement for the project. WHAT NOW? Energy Transfer Partners hopes to complete the pipeline by year's end. The North Dakota's portion is the longest leg (about 360 miles) and the most expensive ($1.4 billion). Regulators in South Dakota and Illinois have already approved permits. Iowa still remains, though the company says it expects that approval to come next month. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also must approve the pipeline because it would cross beneath the Missouri River twice in North Dakota, near Williston and Mandan. PIPELINE'S PATH Energy Transfer Partners says it has easement agreements on 85 percent of the properties along the pipeline's path, which crosses 50 counties, and will use eminent domain if agreements with landowners can't be reached voluntarily. Easements can bring significant money for landowners: A couple in south-central North Dakota said they signed a 99-year easement worth almost $50,000 to allow a half-mile of pipeline on their farm. SAFETY MEASURES The steel pipeline will vary in diameter from 12 inches to 30 inches and would be buried at least 4 feet below ground \u2014 up to 64 feet at Missouri River crossings. The company says it would have safeguards including leak detection equipment, and that workers who remotely monitor the pipeline from Texas could close block valves on the pipeline within three minutes if a breach is detected.","label":0}

Zaman and its English-language sister paper, along with the affiliated Cihan news agency, were taken over by the state, with police using tear gas to storm the building. The once-critical paper then began to run headlines in favour of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Armed police continue to occupy the building where the paper is published. \"Under Erdogan any journalist can be detained or blocked from traveling abroad. I am concerned about my situation,\" Akarcesme said. She denied reports she was seeking asylum in Europe. Zaman is seen as a media outlet affiliated with the movement of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic preacher who was once an ally of the Turkish government but fell from grace with Erdogan in recent years. The government has pushed the line that the preacher's movement, known as Hizmet (Service), is a terrorist group. Officials from the European Union, which Turkey has been trying to join for decades, were critical of the takeover, the latest move against opposition outlets. Despite their condemnations, EU officials have moved ahead, inking a migration deal with Turkey last week. Erdogan continues to insist the media in Turkey is free, despite growing concerns about arrests and takeovers. Turkey consistently ranks low of press freedom indices. \"We are not fighting against democracy but against terrorism, not against freedom but terrorists, not against human rights but terror acts,\" Erdogan said on Monday. # Notebook * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Shabtai Gold - Editing by: Shane Strowmatt, +49 30 2852 31472, dpa shg shs","label":0}

The statement said: \"The Compliance Review Committee met on April 5, to discuss the outstanding issues related to the implementation of the 2015 Code in the Kenyan legal system.

The Garuda Indonesia plane, full of Muslim pilgrims en route to Saudi Arabia, had reached Indian airspace when the nuclear-capable missile flew through the sky. The incident on Thursday has triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries, with Indonesia's foreign ministry demanding an explanation as to why no warning was given. But New Delhi said this was not the case. \"A notice was sent a week before the test by Indian aviation authorities to ATC (air traffic control) Jakarta and other ATCs in the region informing them about the launch window dates, danger time, zone and height,\" Indian foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna told reporters in New Delhi. \"The ATCs were requested to take action to issue notice to aviators and mariners in accordance with relevant ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) provisions,\" said Sarna. The statement came as Indonesia threatened to lodge a formal protest, with national carrier Garuda's operations director quoted as saying that \"no prior information about the test\" had been given. The Boeing 747 jet carrying 400 people aborted its flight after 90 minutes and returned to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, an Indonesian report said. Sarna also said India's missile tests were perfectly safe. \"India's missile testing programme has always followed the requisite safety precautions including in the case of the Agni missile test,\" he said. The jet's exact location relative to the missile, which trailed orange and yellow smoke as it rocketed skyward, has not yet been made public. Air India also said one of its incoming passenger flights from Singapore had to return to the city-state because of the missile launch, the Press Trust of India reported. India announced Thursday the successful test-firing of the medium-range ballistic missile, which can transport a one-tonne nuclear warhead as far away as Beijing.

Silva was sworn in as chief aide to President Dilma Rousseff on Thursday, a post that will let the charismatic politician help the president battle an impeachment effort and one that also makes it harder to investigate any possible links to a corruption scandal at the state oil company. Opponents quickly won injunctions from two regional federal judges to block his appointment, but both were quickly overturned. Later in the afternoon a federal judge in the city of Assis, Sao Paulo state ordered a third injunction blocking Silva from assuming his Cabinet post. The Solicitor General's Office told the G1 news portal it plans to file an appeal but did not specify when. Supporters of Silva, who was one of the world's most famous leaders as president from 2003 to 2010, gathered in rallies across Brazil, particularly in the industrial south, where the former factory worker has his base. In Sao Paulo, tens of thousands gathered on Avenida Paulista in front of the city's art museum. Most wore red T-shirts and caps and frequently chanted, \"Lula, the minister of hope.\" When Silva appeared on top of a large sound truck to address the crowd he was greeted with loud cheers and shouts of \"Lula, Lula.\" \"Next week, if there is no impediment, I will start to proudly serve President Dilma and the Brazilian people,\" he said. \"I am not going back to the government to fight but to help,\" he said. \"I am going back to help President Dilma do what must be done \u2014 re-establish peace and hope. There is no room for hate in this country.\" He wound up his 20 minute speech staring at the crowd and shouting: \"there will be no coup.\" \"Lula, Dilma and the Worker's Party are the only ones who have helped the poor, gave us access to better education, jobs and health care,\" said Ronaldo Carlos a 35-year-old private security guard as he waved a red and white banner with Rousseff's face and the phrase \"Dilma Stays\" on it. The political turmoil comes as Brazil prepares to host the Summer Olympics in August and Latin America's most populous nation faces crises on several fronts. The country is at the center of an outbreak of the Zika virus, which health experts believe can cause abnormally small heads in newborns. And its economy, long an engine for neighboring countries, has sharply contracted by nearly 4 percent. Inflation has spiked the last year and announcements of job layoffs have become common. Rousseff's opponents accuse her of trying to help Silva avoid legal woes. Less than two weeks ago, he was taken in for questioning in the sprawling Petrobras kickback probe that has ensnared both allies and rivals of the former president. Cabinet members cannot be investigated, charged or imprisoned unless authorized by the Supreme Court. Rousseff supporters have a different take: They say the 70-year-old Silva, known for his ability to build consensus and disarming charisma, could save Rousseff's job and help bring the economy back from the abyss. Rousseff, with approval ratings in the single digits, is fighting against attempts to oust her over allegations of fiscal mismanagement unrelated to the Petrobras case. The move toward impeachment advanced this week as the lower house established a special commission on the matter. Both Rousseff and Lula have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In a public letter Friday, Silva called the last two weeks \"sad and embarrassing episodes\" that hurt all Brazilians. As he often does, he harkened to his hardscrabble past. He noted he had little formal education, \"But I know, as a human being, how to distinguish between right and wrong, and what is justice and injustice.\" He also questioned the legality of the surprise release of tapped phone calls between him and a host of prominent public figures, including Rousseff herself. Judge Sergio Moro, overseeing the Petrobras case, released the recordings late Wednesday, hours after the announcement of Silva's appointment, saying that the taps appeared to suggest attempts to influence judicial officials in Lula's favor. Rousseff called the recordings illegal and said their release made \"clear the attempt to overstep the limits of the democratic state.\" The simmering anger that bought an estimated 3 million people onto the streets in nationwide anti-government demonstrations over the weekend again spilled over Thursday with protests in Brasilia and Sao Paulo.","label":1}

Amplats said in a statement at the weekend it had reached an agreement with unions and workers' representatives to reinstate the 12,000 employees dismissed, and that they were expected to return to work on Tuesday. Mdoda said workers had heard of this through the media, which made it difficult for their representatives to explain the agreement to them. \"We have been in meetings with management and the unions. We cannot take any  offer without consulting the workers. They have rejected the offer.\" He expressed concern that the situation could turn violent on Tuesday if some workers did report for duty. \"We have not signed that agreement. The sms sent by the company to workers  is complicating this issue and confusing workers. We call on workers not to be violent, but to resolve this peacefully.\" Amplats said it had offered to reinstate all workers on the same terms and conditions of employment as applied before their illegal strike. The workers would receive a final written disciplinary warning instead of being dismissed. The company had further offered a once-off hardship allowance of R2000 to help workers deal with financial difficulties arising from the no-work, no-pay principle in place while they were striking. Workers who did not participate in the strike would receive a once-off loyalty allowance of R2000. In addition, employees affected by the no-work, no-pay rule could apply for loan of up to R2500 each, repayable over six months from January 2013. Workers were expected to report for duty at 7am on Tuesday. Amplats workers went on strike on September 12, demanding a monthly salary of R16,000. On Saturday, National Union of Mineworkers' secretary Frans Baleni said strikes could score short-term gains, but result in permanent losses. \"Prolonged strikes may lead to the company closing down,\" he said after a Congress of SA Trade Unions rally in Rustenburg.

Captain Thulani Zwane said the 44-year-old man was arrested while he was busy with his duties at a school in Madadeni township on Thursday. Four other people were arrested on February 2 in connection with the case, including an employee at a funeral parlour and a local taxi owner. \"After the arrest of the four suspects the owner of the funeral parlour was found dead with gunshot wounds in Besters near Ladysmith,\" Zwane said. He said police were still investigating the murder of the funeral owner and no arrests had yet been made. \"At this stage it is not clear if the murder was related to the funeral policy scam,\" Zwane said. Police had been investigating a fraudulent claim worth R6 million which was lodged. R3 million was paid out in October. \"The claims were made against an insured life of Themba Nene from Mazizini area in Bergville. Police investigations revealed that Nene had actually died in 2011 not in October 2012 as stated in the claim forms,\" Zwane said. The Nene family used the Mthumeni funeral service for the burial of their son and was told by the funeral parlour owner that they could not register his death at the home affairs department because his ID was missing. The parlour owner then allegedly used Themba's ID to take out life cover for  him when he was already dead, without his family's knowledge. \"In January an employee from the funeral parlour visited the Nene family and  brought with him an amount of R15,000 and the ID book, saying that it had been misplaced but now it has been found.  \"He further told them that the money was compensation for misplacing the ID,\" Zwane said.

He appeared in the Cape District Court before magistrate Nasha Banwari who extended his R500 bail and postponed the case to September 5. On June 3 the case was postponed to August 12 for the defence to submit written representations to the prosecuting authorities for the withdrawal of the charges. At Tuesday's proceedings, attorney Waheed Badrodien said representations had  not yet been submitted, and could not until more details of the charges had been furnished by prosecutor Adiel Jansen. Badrodien said he had received details, but additional information was needed for a private forensic expert to complete a report. The expert's report would accompany the representations, he said. Yengeni had not yet pleaded to charges of drunk driving and reckless and negligent driving. As an alternative to the drunk driving charge, Yengeni is alleged to have driven with a blood-alcohol level of 0.25 percent, five times the legal limit of 0.05. Yengeni was arrested in August last year after City of Cape Town law enforcement officials saw him allegedly driving his Maserati erratically in the  Cape Town CBD. Police later released him on bail and warned him to make his first court appearance on March 4 this year. In a statement issued after his arrest the city's safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith said Yengeni had been one of 52 people arrested during a weekend operation. Smith alleged that at least one of Yengeni's car number plates was missing at the time. He said a screening device indicated that Yengeni was substantially over the  blood alcohol level. For this reason Yengeni was taken to the \"shadow centre\" for a blood sample to be taken and sent to a lab for analysis.

Baker said that police investigating the triple murder could not  find the rape report matching the allegations the attackers made at  any of the area's police stations. Enquiries in the community had not yet found the girl at the centre of the charge. \"Nobody can tell us anything,\" Baker said. However, one person had been arrested in connection with the necklacing and the investigation was at a sensitive stage, Baker told Sapa. He would appear in a court in Humansdorp on Tuesday. \"Everybody is a bit shocked and tense. We thought this kind of thing was over,\" Baker added. -- \"Necklacing\" was a feared method of murder during the apartheid years and was a common method of killing people believed to be police informers.

The so-called Mannesmann case -- in which the six defendants stand accused of breach of fiduciary duty for their role in approving huge bonuses following the takeover of German telecom giant Mannesmann in 2000 -- was ordered to be re-tried by the Federal Supreme Court last December. Ackermann along with former Mannesmann chairman Klaus Esser, Mannesmann's former supervisory board chief Joachim Funk, the former head of the powerful IG Metall labour union, Klaus Zwickel, and two others, Juergen Ladberg and Dietmar Drost had all originally been acquitted in July 2004. The men were found not guilty of breaking the law by approving a  total 111.5 million marks (57 million euros, 72 million dollars) in  payouts for former Mannesmann executives. Esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros. At the time, the court had ruled that while the size of the payouts went against Mannesmann's interests and were therefore not admissable under German stock law, they did not constitute criminal  action, as claimed by the prosecution. But the Federal Supreme Court ordered a re-trial in December 2005.  And some observers believe that that could the future of Ackermann at the head of Deutsche Bank in question.  Ackermann is one of the most powerful private bankers in Germany, but during the first trial he had to attend court twice a week for six months. A repetition of this would make his position untenable as Deutsche Bank chief executive, some observers believe. At the time of the Mannesmann payouts, Ackermann had been a member of the group's supervisory board.  The case has put executive pay in Germany in the spotlight and Ackermann and his defence team argue that big payouts to executives, common in the US and Britain, are needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks. Prosecutors contend that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers, and Esser in particular, to drop their resistance to Vodafone's bid after a long takeover battle. And critics saw the bonuses, unprecedentedly high by German standards, as evidence of corporate greed, especially as many employees of Mannesmann were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover.  Supporters of Esser say that his courageous defiance of Vodafone's hostile bid, until a price was agreed, actually benefited Mannesmann's shareholders because it pushed the company's  shares ever higher. Ackermann has become a highly unpopular figure in Germany where he has been lambasted for slashing thousands of jobs when Deutsche Bank has been turning in record profits. Sapa-AFP","label":0}

According to a media report on Wednesday, the raid took place on September 28, and specifically targeted the security guards at Mkhize's home on the outskirts of Pietermaritzburg. A guard was allegedly arrested and a firearm confiscated. The operation, read the Witness newspaper's report, was linked to ongoing investigations by a special police task team investigating political killings in the province. ANC KZN secretary, Mdumiseni Ntuli, made the statements on Wednesday while responding to questions during a media briefing at the party' Durban headquarters. He said the provincial leadership had not received \"concrete or accurate reports\" about the raid. \"We have heard about it in the media. I have not had an opportunity to talk to him (Mkhize), so I don't know if it is true. But if there were such raids, I am quite certain they would have been handled within the parameters of the law and respect accorded to him and his family,\" said Ntuli. Mkhize is a former ANC provincial chairperson, former premier and former national treasurer. Wednesday's briefing was called to inform the media of various decisions taken at the party's provincial executive committee (PEC) meeting held over the weekend, said Ntuli. He said the conduct of party members who supported \"other comrades\" that were arrested for alleged political killings had been discussed and the PEC felt strongly that members should try to distance themselves from those implicated. \"A number of comrades have been arrested in Pietermaritzburg who are accused of having been involved directly or indirectly in the killing of comrades, including the murder of comrade Musawenkosi Mchunu. The PEC has agreed that ANC members need to distinguish between supporting a comrade who has been accused and support of the victims,\" said Ntuli. \"The position of the ANC is that nobody should be allowed to go to court to support comrades who are arrested as a consequence of allegations that they were involved in the killing or assassination of other comrades.\" Mchunu, an ANC activist and former councillor, was shot dead in May while turning into his driveway in the kwaPata area of Pietermaritzburg. Msunduzi Municipality (Pietermaritzburg) ward 10 councillor Nkosinathi Gambu, was arrested along with five others on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The suspects will appear again at the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Thursday. Ntuli said the ANC must \"always be on the side of justice\" and \"in favour of the victims rather than being seen as supporting the perpetrators\". \"We cannot dictate to the families of the perpetrators, but we believe that members of the ANC will have to exercise restraint and avoid going to court and thereby project an organisation that is at war with itself,\" said Ntuli. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":1}

DKMS founder Peter Harf had the honor of presenting Alejandro Santo Domingo,  a long-standing board member and loyal supporter of DKMS, Senior Managing Director, Quadrant Capital Advisors with the \"Fight Against Blood Cancer Award\"  for supporting organizations and charities dedicated to the cause.  \"We are eternally grateful for the support of our corporate founding sponsor, Coty, and other long-term supporters for joining our fight against blood cancer,\" said Katharina Harf. \"With the $3.2 million we raised, we will be able to register almost 50,000 new bone marrow donors who will help save lives. We all witnessed a miracle of a donor and patient meeting at the gala and with your support we can make more miracles happen.\"  The biggest highlight of the evening was \"The Moment of the Match\" when Katharina Harf introduced Mindi Finch and her young son, Gregory, met Katie D'Entremont, who saved Gregory's life. The three met for the first time on stage. Six-year-old Gregory and his charming smile touched every heart in the room.

To play a part in the great work of DKMS  and the Linked Against Blood Cancer partnership has been an amazing experience.\"  Coty joined DKMS in October 2006 in the fight against blood cancer.  Blood cancer also touched Coty Inc. in a very personal manner in 1991, when the wife of former longtime Coty Inc. Chairman Peter Harf succumbed to leukemia.

The Trump development's 40-year  lease also is longer than any other state parks contract except that of the Maid of the Mist boat ride at Niagara Falls, according to the newspaper. Newsday cited records obtained through a Freedom of Information Law request, as well as the newspaper's analysis of state leases. Set on five acres at popular Jones Beach, Trump on the Ocean would afford sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean. The facility is to feature indoor and beachfront dining and accommodate events for large-scale events accommodating up to 1,400 people. It would replace the Boardwalk Restaurant, which was demolished more than two years ago. Construction is expected to start soon on the project, which Trump has said will cost {dollar}40 million. The lease payments are set to vary over the years. Trump on the Ocean will pay a {dollar}200,000-a-year base rent - less than 1 percent of  its expected {dollar}70 million in revenue - for its first three years, according to Newsday. In its fourth through sixth years, the facility would pay a combination of base rent and a cut of sales, altogether amounting to about 2.7 percent of the expected revenue. That would rise to about 4.7 percent of revenue for the rest of the first 25 percent, Newsday reported. Several other major state parks concessionaires pay between 6 and 15 percent, according to the newspaper. State officials pointed to the cost of the Trump project and the  absence of any guarantee on its revenue, Newsday reported. The officials also noted that Trump's group ultimately was the only bidder for the project. The 40-year length of the lease was approved by state legislators before Trump became involved. Backers said a longer lease would attract a bigger investment, according to Newsday. The state ultimately expects to take in about {dollar}74 million over the 40-year term of the Trump on the Ocean lease, as well as additional money from the caterers for ongoing renovations, Newsday  reported. Also, the building will belong to the state. \"It's going to be a very important thing for Long Island, and it's going to be a very glamorous thing for Long Island,\" Trump told the newspaper.

She reached this conclusion using the \"duck test\": \"If something looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is probably a duck,\" she said.  \"Of course, the 'duck' in this case refers to a purge of anyone who gets too  close to investigating corruption in Zuma\u2019s network.\" She conceded, however, that \"this is a very complex case\". Zille said Zuma closed the Hawks' predecessors, the Scorpions, while he was awaiting charges of fraud and corruption, which were subsequently withdrawn; Dramat was suspended in December even though the Constitutional Court ruled in November that a clause giving the police minister the power to do this was unconstitutional. The DA knew, on the grounds of a meeting between Dramat's lawyers and Robert  McBride, head of the Independent Police Investigating Directorate, that Dramat was cleared of alleged involvement in renditions to Zimbabwe. \"After the Constitutional Court ruling in November, Dramat asked for the Nkandla file to be handed over to the Hawks for investigation. \"...SA Police Service did not comply, and shortly after this Dramat was suspended by Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko.\" Zille questioned the timing of Dramat's suspension, given that her party understood the Ipid probe clearing him was concluded nine months previously. \"It most certainly quacks like a duck,\" she wrote.  His replacement Maj-Gen Benny Ntlemeze's target appeared to be Lt-Gen Johan Booysen, head of the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal, because he started investigating influential people linked to Zuma, she said. On Monday the High Court in Pretoria heard an application by the Helen Suzman Foundation for Nhleko's decision to suspend Dramat to be set aside. Judgment was reserved.  Nhleko's spokesman Musa Zondi told reporters that the minister was prepared to meet Dramat to iron out issues. \"There is no witch-hunt. Once you take that out, anything is possible. The minister has an open mind,\" he said. Sapa \/jje\/mjs\/fg\/ks","label":0}

The reporter, Remy Pigaglio, who worked for several publications, including Catholic daily La Croix, was returning from vacation in France and prevented from entering Egypt on Tuesday. Pigaglio said he has a residency work permit and a press card, and was detained for 30 hours at the Cairo International Airport before being sent back to Paris. Authorities twice inspected photos on Pigaglio's mobile phone, confiscated his passport, and barred him from speaking with embassy officials and family until Tuesday evening, his newspaper said. He was held overnight in a cell at the airport. La Croix also said the French Embassy tried to intervene on his behalf but did not manage to prevent the deportation. \"Nothing was confiscated from me and I wasn't treated badly,\" Pigaglio told the paper. \"I was not interrogated, and I never knew, and still do not know, why this decision was made to ban me from entering the territory.\" French journalists in Egypt demanded an explanation, saying in a note that the deportation was a sign of \"authorities' growing repression of Egyptian and foreign media: surveillance, arrest, expulsion and detention.\" Journalists have been regularly detained, jailed, and prosecuted under the rule of el-Sissi, who led the 2013 military overthrow of the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president. Foreigners working in a variety of fields have been denied entry to Egypt without explanation. Egypt was ranked 158 out of 180 countries in the 2015 Press Freedom Index, according to Reporters Without Borders, a freedom of expression advocacy group. In December, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Egypt was second only to China as the world's worst jailer of journalists in 2015. In an unrelated development, defense lawyers said a Cairo appeals court quashed five-year prison terms handed down on May 14 against 47 anti-government protesters convicted of breaking a law that effectively bans street demonstrations. However, they said the court upheld the lower tribunal's decision to slap a fine of 100,000 pounds (about 10,000 dollars) on each of the 47 protesters. The appeals court verdict was passed late Tuesday. The 47 were among a total of 152 protesters convicted on May 14 of breaking the demonstrations law during protests on April 25 against the government's decision to hand over control of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. The 152 were sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to five years, many were tried in absentia. Earlier this month, a new draft bill was up in Egypt's parliament on regulating the media. Journalists say it would likely bring the demise of dozens of low-budget, online media outlets serving as refuge for young writers and liberal activists escaping government restrictions on freedom of expression. Awaiting approval by a parliament dominated by el-Sissi loyalists, lawmakers are also set to approve clauses that would ban all live video transmissions without permits. Insiders expect such permits will be denied to non-state media. European Union member states broadly back el-Sissi and continue to sell Egypt sophisticated weaponry under the rationale that the country needs the firepower to fight a growing insurgency by Islamic militants in the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt, they argue, remains a bulwark of stability in a volatile Middle East. But the harsh crackdown on critics has left thousands jailed and fanned doubts over el-Sissi's leadership, with many nations voicing concerns. Close partner Italy has been particularly critical after an Italian doctoral student was found tortured to death after disappearing on Jan. 25, a day that saw a massive police presence in Cairo, prompting accusations that Egypt's security services were involved. Italy has withdrawn its ambassador to Cairo over the case of Giulio Regeni and said Egypt was not being sufficiently cooperative in the investigation. Egypt denies its security services were involved in Regeni's killing.","label":1}

Retired Brigadier General Agrippa Mutambara, who also served as Zimbabwe ambassador to three different countries over a 21-year span and was now a member of an opposition political party , said Zanu PF had no future in the politics of the country, adding that opposition political parties should rally together to remove the liberation war movement from power. He was speaking at a roundtable discussion under the topic, \"Emergence of new political outfits, new perspective or political ego\", held at the Media Centre in Harare. \"I sincerely believe that Zanu PF will not win another election and I think they also know that the tables are turning and they are resorting to a well-known tactic that they have used in the past and succeeded. The tactic of using violence, using youths to unleash violence on people who don't support Zanu PF,\" he said. Mutambara, who said he voluntarily left the ruling party to join former Vice President, Joice Mujuru, who was unceremoniously kicked out of the party and formed her own outfit, Zimbabwe People First, said what happened at Rufaro Stadium when the Zimbabwe government tried to organise a workers' day event that turned out to be a flop was an indication that the ruling party was unelectable. \"That was not an indication that (Vice President Emmerson) Mnangagwa had failed, it was an indication that Zanu PF was unelectable, not an individual because the Vice President was appointed by the President. But if Zanu PF itself thinks that he is unelectable, then it is a vote of no confidence in the President who actually appointed him,\" he said. The liberation war veteran said many people were turning away from Zanu PF because it had strayed from the principles of the liberation struggle and was now trying to create one centre of power, saying that was not what the people fought for. \"If Zanu PF enjoys support, why is it that they have to harass and force people to accept them? If Zanu PF has got support, why is it that when just holding a provincial rally, they have to send buses across the country to shuttle people to come and attend a rally. It is a clear indication that Zanu PF has lost support and they want to give an impression that they still enjoy support when they do not,\" he said. The ruling party, he said, was abusing and misusing state resources meant for the people of Zimbabwe and giving them to their supporters. Mutambara, who himself held senior positions in the Zanu PF government, said he had tendered his notice of retirement from government because he wanted to feel free to express himself about what was going on within the ruling party, saying the situation had become untenable. \"Zanu PF has lost direction. Within Zanu PF, I tried to communicate my apprehension of what I thought was going on but without success. Unlike many of my comrades, I was not dismissed from Zanu PF. I took a personal decision that I could no longer continue to be Zanu PF. If you look at the number of people that are being expelled and suspended, you find that the party has lost direction,\" he said. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Emigration has been a feature of South African  life since the Soweto riots of the 1970s, and still continues unabated. Oz-Lifestyle was opened to target this niche, and offers a unique end-to-end immigration service.  Neal Allen, a past head of SABC television studios, has found a new audience - and a fairly large one at that - South Africans wanting to emigrate. Launched this year, 'Oz-Lifestyle' is an immigration service targeting South Africans' wishing to move to Australia. Allen seems to have a knack for assessing trends, which he was known for at the SABC. \"I saw a gap in the market for an agency that handled immigration end-to-end and so Oz-Lifestyle was born. Many South Africans wish to immigrate but find it daunting.\" says Allen. Why Australia of all places though? If intentions to return home are anything to go by, Australia is the place to go. \"South Africans who have immigrated to Australia are far less likely to want to return, when compared to their peers who immigrated to the UK. If you imagine countries as competitors, competing for scarce skills, Australia is in fact South Africa's biggest threat.\" says Allen.   Emigration from South Africa has always been a fact of life, but  showed a clear escalation in the late 1970s after the Soweto riots.  Another two emigration peaks occurred, firstly in the mid 1980s after the Rubicon speech, and again at the time of the first democratic elections. \"In the 1970s, Europe was the most popular destination of choice, Australia only being chosen 14% of the time.  This changed in the 1980s, Australia becoming the destination of choice in almost a third of cases. As people have become aware of Australia's attractive features it has become increasingly preferred.\" says Allen.  \"Just before the 1993 elections, emigration increased, and continued at a higher level, another increase occurring at the turn  of the millennium. Research, based on destination country statistics, has shown that SA's official statistics are typically only a third of the real figures. Today, everyone knows someone who  has left the country. The reasons for immigration include crime, economic concerns, and political stability.\" says Allen. Australia is seen as an attractive choice due to its economic stability, and the similarity of cultures and lifestyle. \"The climate is particularly suited to South Africans who enjoy an outdoor lifestyle and beautiful open landscapes\".  Allen's passion as a trainer and mentor has now focused on overcoming the major challenge facing many South Africans who feel that they want, or must immigrate. \"Immigrating to another country is increasingly difficult in the post 9\/11 world, and not only immigration to America, but to many other first world countries whose citizens are concerned about the influx of foreigners. As a result there is a definite need for guidance amongst those wishing to immigrate.\" says Allen.  Australia's strong economy has resulted in a desperate need for skilled labour. In response, the Australian government created a Visa scheme, which eases immigration for those with the desired skills, labeled the Australian Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS Visa).  Oz-LifeStyle offers 'fast track' immigration via the RSMS and other immigration options. \"We are fairly unique in that we have offices in both countries so that we can assist clients on both sides of the Indian Ocean - it is not a case of dump and run. When clients arrive in Australia, one of our staff is on hand to welcome  them. We guide potential candidates right from the beginning, through our unique 9 step process, which includes an employment search and assistance with moving. We even provide clients with advice on which locales have high South African immigrant populations, increasing the chances that clients will integrate without problems.\" say","label":0}

Defence attorney Peter Daubermann brought an application earlier on Wednesday to compel the State to furnish further information pertaining to the charge sheet. Daubermann slammed the charge sheet saying it was vague and infringed on his clients right to a fair trial. He wants the State to provide the times, dates and places of the alleged offences. He argued that his clients, including co-accused alleged henchwomen Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, were unable to provide alibis because of the vagueness of the charges. But State Prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa said the defence was once again on the attack. Ntelwa said the State provided the defence with further details at the previous trial and at the time the defence was \"happy\". \"There was no application to compel. We provided the specifics they were looking for and the information we didn't have the defence accepted,\" said Ntelwa. Ntelwa argued that from the information provided Omotoso and his co-accuser were able to build a defence. The 58-year-old televangelist allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women who were from various branches of his Jesus Dominion International (JDI) church to a house in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them. He was arrested on April 20, 2017, by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, at the Port Elizabeth Airport. He has been denied bail on two occasions as he was deemed a flight risk. The women were arrested in November 2017 and are out on bail of R2,000. Omotoso faces 63 main charges, including human trafficking, rape and sexual assault. Omotoso's co-accused, are accused of recruiting girls from all over the country for purposes of sexual exploitation.

The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its index of factory activity in November dropped to 48.6 from 50.1 in October. Any reading below 50 signals contraction and the index has tumbled below that critical level for the first time since November 2012. It now rests at its lowest level since June 2009, a worrisome sign as Federal Reserve officials will consider raising short-term interest rates this month on the understanding that the economy has sufficiently healed from the Great Recession. U.S. manufacturers hit a rut in 2015. A global economic slowdown and a rising dollar have crimped exports, while lower oil prices have led energy firms to slash their orders for steel pipe and other equipment for drilling. Those pressures have steadily curbed growth in factory activity this year and have now pushed the manufacturing sector into contraction. A measure for new orders dropped to 48.9 from 52.9, while production fell to 49.2 from 52.9. Still, the report showed a rebound in hiring as its employment measure improved to 51.3 from 47.6 a month earlier. U.S. manufacturers have been squeezed this year as a strong dollar and weak economies in China and other key foreign markets have cut into exports The dollar has appreciated nearly 14 percent against a grouping of major currencies from a year ago. The increase has left manufacturers at a disadvantage. U.S. goods have become more expensive overseas, while lowering prices for imported goods that compete against American products. China has been stuck in a slowdown, as has Brazil. Europe \u2014 a major trade partner \u2014 remains economically fragile, while Canada and Japan have sunk into recession. Companies trimmed their stockpiles of goods between July and September, the government said last week. That cut economic growth during those three months at an annualized rate of 0.6 percentage points, even though overall growth advanced 2.1 percent.

A peace pact in the so-called \"Spice Wars\" was agreed in the High Court in London between chairman Kirit Pathak and his two married sisters, who claimed they had been cheated out of shares allocated to them by their late father. The sisters, Chitralekha Mehta, 56, and Anila Shastri, 52, said they expected to receive around four million pounds each under the settlement. \"We are both very happy.

But the details have still to be translated into Gujerati so that the family's 77-year-old matriarch, Shantagaury Pathak, who backed her son in court, can agree to the deal.

Police in Southern California said they were responding to a 911 call from a friend of former WWE wrestler Chyna when they found her dead in her Redondo Beach apartment. A friend had gone Wednesday to check on Chyna, whose real name is Joan Marie Laurer, after she had failed to answer her phone for a few days, Redondo Beach police said in a statement. The friend told the 911 operator that Laurer wasn't breathing. The 46-year-old Laurer was dead when officers arrived, police said. Several media outlets report that she was 45. Neither police nor coroner's officials have released any cause of death. A coroner's investigator was still at the location with the body late Wednesday night, according to Los Angeles County coroner's Lt. Larry Dietz. He said he had no further information on the death. The tall, muscle-bound, raven-haired Laurer billed herself as the \"9th Wonder of the World\" because her wrestling predecessor Andre the Giant had already called himself the eighth. She was a member of the wrestling squad that dubbed itself \"D-Generation X,\" often wrestled against men and at one point was the WWE women's champion. On her official website a statement posted Wednesday night reads, \"Today we lost a true icon, a real life superhero. Joanie Laurer aka Chyna, the 9th Wonder of the World has passed away. She will live forever in the memories of her millions of fans and all of us that loved her.\" Laurer was a native of Rochester, New York and graduated from the University of Tampa in Florida before taking up wrestling. She joins a long list of WWE professional wrestlers who have died relatively young, including Rick Rude, Curt \"Mr. Perfect\" Hennig, the Ultimate Warrior and Owen Hart. After leaving the WWE in 2001, Laurer posed for Playboy and appeared in adult films and on reality TV, including the shows \"The Surreal Life\" and \"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.\" ___ This story has been updated to reflect that Laurer was 46, according to a police statement.","label":0}

A massive lobbying effort by oil and gas interests to delay the rules was unsuccessful, according to US media reports. High sulfur content in gasoline creates more pollutants and adds to smog and  soot in the air. Supporters of the new rules hailed the move as a crucial step in Obama's second term as US president. The new standards could be \"the most significant air pollution policy President Obama will adopt in his second term,\" S. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, was quoted as telling the Washington Post. \"There is not another air pollution control strategy that we know of that will produce as substantial, cost-effective and expeditious emissions reductions.\" The proposed standards are to be published in the Federal Register, after which there will be a period of public comment.

Defending champions, Western Province, held their nerve in torrid weather conditions in Cape Town to outplay the Free State Cheetahs 32-0, which saw them take top spot on the log on points difference in the competition. In the other matches, the Sharks registered a 26-10 victory against the Blue Bulls in Durban, and a hat-trick by Golden Lions winger Courtnall Skosan and a brace by young No 8 Hacjivah Dayimani steered them to a rewarding 62-41 victory against Griquas in Johannesburg. The first half between Western Province and the Free State Cheetahs was slow and error-ridden as the teams tried hard to adapt to the heavy rain and swirling wind at Newlands, and it was no surprise that the only points in the first 39 minutes were two penalty goals by Western Province's SP Marais. The hosts, however, made a vital breakthrough on the stroke of halftime as Ruhan Nel crossed the chalk to hand them a 13-0 lead, which they built on in the second half to take their try tally to four, while they denied the visitors a single point. The Sharks' effective finishing earned them the 26-10 victory against theBlue Bulls in Durban, who will be rueing the missed opportunities as mistakes at crucial times came at a high price. The home team scored three first-half tries to one converted try and penalty goal by the Blue Bulls for a 21-10 halftime lead, and this proved important in the end, as the only points scored in the second half was the Sharks' bonus-point try. The first half between the Golden Lions and Griquas was tightly-contested with the visitors taking a slender lead despite scoring two tries to the hosts' three, thanks to two penalty goals by George Whitehead. But two tries in quick succession by the Golden Lions after the break and another four as the match progressed sealed the victory for them. The men from the Northern Cape earned an important bonus point thanks to their five tries.

Caceres, a Lenca Indian activist, had previously complained of receiving death threats from police, soldiers and local landowners because of her work. Tomas Membreno, a member of her group, the Indian Council of People's Organizations of Honduras, group said at least two assailants broke into a home and shot Caceres to death early Thursday in the town of La Esperanza. \"Honduras has lost a brave and committed social activist,\" Membreno said in a statement. Caceres, a mother of four, led opposition to a proposed dam on the Gualcarque river, considered sacred by the Lencas. Many of the project's backers have largely abandoned building plans.

But if South Africa moves quickly enough to allow US poultry into the country by March 15, the suspension will not come into effect. Obama issued a proclamation late on Monday suspending thee duty-free access of South African agricultural products into the US market under Agoa \u2013 the African Growth and Opportunity Act. But the proclamation also said the suspension would only come into effect on March 15 this year. This came as something of a surprise since last week South African and US officials had agreed on the terms for allowing US poultry, beef and pork into the South African market. South Africa has been blocking these imports, citing health concerns about diseases in the meat. But veterinary experts on both sides agreed last Wednesday on measures to deal with those concerns, opening the way for the meat to come in. The barriers to the three meats entering South Africa were the main reasons Obama provisionally suspended South Africa's agricultural Agoa benefits on November 5 last year. But he gave South Africa 60 days \u2013 effectively until January 4 - to comply with US conditions. A fourth condition, though, was that US poultry should actually be on South African shelves by January 4. It was because this deadline was not met, that Obama issued the proclamation, US embassy spokesperson Cindy Harvey explained in a statement. She stressed that \"No suspension of benefits is taking place today\" and added that Obama's extension of the effective date for suspending South Africa's Agoa benefits to March 15 \"creates an opportunity for American poultry to enter into commerce in South Africa prior to the suspension of benefits\". \"Now that the substantive points of disagreement have been resolved, we hope and expect the resumption of trade in the three meats to take place smoothly and expeditiously,\" Harvey said. \"If the remaining benchmark \u2013 the entry of US poultry into South Africa under the agreed-upon conditions \u2013 is met before March 15, 2016, the president will be able to consider a revocation of the proclamation before suspension takes effect. \"The president can also reinstate full Agoa benefits for South Africa any time after he has determined that South Africa is meeting the criteria laid out by the Congress.\" The proclamation may be in part a formality, the fulfilment of what he said he would do on November 5. But it may also reflect some residual uncertainty by the US government that South Africa will move expeditiously to implement last week's agreements. Throughout the drawn-out negotiations over removing the barriers to US meat imports, US officials have complained that South Africa has agreed to remove obstacles, but then found new obstacles. And so the US Trade Representative Michael Froman, who would have advised Obama to issue the proclamation, may have felt the US needed to keep some sort of sword still handing over South Africa's head to encourage it not to dawdle. - (African News Agency)","label":0}

The  speedy response - many software manufacturers take months to do similar repairs - underscored the seriousness of the threat, which affected the latest corporate versions of Symantec Antivirus. The company said the patch is available using its LiveUpdate technology, which distributes the latest antivirus protections. The  company said it has not detected efforts by hackers to exploit the antivirus flaw. Symantec said its engineers have worked 24 hours a day on the problem since its discovery last week by eEye Digital Security Inc.  of Aliso Viejo, California. \"Symantec is a company used to responding rapidly,\" said Vince Weafer, senior director for Symantec's security response unit.

The world's largest mobile-phone maker said users will be able to activate for free its \"Find My Mobile\" and \"Reactivation Lock\" anti-theft features to protect the soon-to-be-released Galaxy 5 S. The features that will lock the phone if there's an unauthorized attempt to reset it will be on models sold by wireless carriers Verizon and U.S. Cellular.  The phones go on sale next week. \"Samsung takes the issue of smartphone theft very seriously, and we are continuing to enhance our security and anti-theft solutions,\" the company said in a statement. The announcement comes as San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon, New  York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and other U.S. law enforcement officials demand that manufacturers create kill switches to combat surging smartphone theft across America. Earlier this week, California legislators introduced a bill that, if passed,  would require mobile devices sold in or shipped in the state be equipped with the anti-theft devices starting next year - a move that could be the first of its kind in the United States. Similar legislation is being considered in New York, Illinois, Minnesota, and bills have been introduced in both houses of Congress. In July, Samsung officials told Gascon's office that the major carriers were  resisting using kill switches. However, Gascon and Schneiderman said in a joint  statement Friday that Samsung's latest move sends a strong message that the wireless industry can work together to make consumers safe. The prosecutors have given the manufacturers a June deadline to find solutions to curb smartphone theft. \"More work needs to be done to ensure that these solutions come standard on every device, but these companies have done the right thing by responding to our call for action,\" the prosecutors said. \"No family should lose a mother, a father, a son or a daughter for their phone. Manufacturers and carriers need to  put public safety before corporate profits and stop this violent epidemic, which has put millions of smartphone users at risk.\" Apple created a similar \"activation lock\" feature for the popular iPhone last year. Almost one in three U.S. robberies involve phone theft, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Lost and stolen mobile devices -mostly smartphones - cost consumers more than $30 billion in 2012, the agency said in a study. CTIA-The Wireless Association, a trade group for wireless providers, has said a permanent kill switch has serious risks, including potential vulnerability to hackers who could disable mobile devices and lock out not only  individuals' phones but also phones used by entities such as the Department of Defense, Homeland Security and law enforcement. ---- Follow Terry Collins at https:\/\/twitter.com\/aptcollins Sapa-AP \/gm","label":0}

Africa guyuan PRETORIA, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from botched circumcisions has risen to 43 nationwide since the summer initiation season began in November, newly appointed Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, David van Rooyen said on Tuesday. This \"is totally unacceptable\", Van Rooyen told reporters in Pretoria. Eastern Cape Province reported 30 deaths, to be followed by Free State (six), Northern Cape (three), Western Cape (two), Gauteng (one) and North West (one). Van Rooyen said the circumcision ritual faces challenges which include abductions, kidnappings, and mushrooming of illegal and unregistered schools. \"We are working with various stakeholders across various sectors to ensure that our young men can undergo this rite of passage in a safe manner,\" the minister said. He urged parents and guardians to send their young men to registered initiation schools. These schools, he said, should abide by the rules and regulations initiated by the Department of Health. \"We are also working with the department of Health on awareness campaigns to prepare for the next seasons,\" Van Rooyen said. He pledged committment to engaging all stakeholders in the local government sector, from traditional leaders, NGOs to business communities, and expanding on partnerships that have been developed over the years. \"We look forward to engaging with the South African Local Government Association and the Labour movements to ensure they play their meaningful role so that we can all execute on what needs to be accomplished together,\" Van Rooyen said. Illegal initiation rituals, which do not meet health and safety standards, claim many lives in South Africa every year. Between 2005 and 2015, more than 500 initiates died while 300 have lost their manhood, official statistics show. According to local custom, circumcisions are normally viewed as a traditional passage for a young boy to enter manhood. Traditional leaders and local authorities have been campaigning to ensure that circumcisions meet stringent health and safety standards. Enditem","label":0}

It is fundamentally about the nature of power in the world, about legitimacy in the global order and giving  a voice to the voiceless in world affairs. The UN has occupied the position as the world's most important international organization and the Security Council remains the most important entity for the maintenance of international peace and security. The notion of permanent stems directly from the idea that there were winners and losers after the 2nd World War. But there has always been something  fundamentally wrong with this composition.  The UN has always been characterised by more discord and less collaboration. Many of the great powers, notably the superpowers, have always sought to turn the Security Council into instruments of  their foreign policies. What should underlie the restructuring process are common norms and values of both national and international democratic governance, peace, security, economic integration and collective security. If the world order is to be stabilized and democratised, there will have to be greater efforts at bringing about a rules-based order - an order that is able to convince rich and poor, big and small - to play by legitimately arrived at rules. Dictatorships at home and abroad need to be democratized. The UN should be the agency articulating both a principled and ethical global order, while continuing to work hard to bring about a rules-based global order, and through its commitment to multilateralism and address poverty and the devastating HIV\/AIDS crisis. It is only through such a rules-based multilateral order that both developed and developing countries could defend their interests and rights.  The UN of the future will have to better make the links between democracy, governance and peace and security and economic development.  But, it is not only the UN that should be transformed. It is important that the broader global governance architecture be transformed. The entire unaccountable Bretton Woods institutions - the World Bank, IMF and WTO - should not only be brought back in the UN fold; these institutions too need transformation. They have developed major jealousies and territorialities, precisely because they are illegitimate. They are not going to give up their ill-gained sovereignty easily; they are not going to hand it back to the UN on a silver platter. The UN will have to fight hard to reassert its own sovereignty and for the accountability of these other bodies.

Agriculture ministers from the 28 member states of the EU gathered in Brussels on Monday to discuss the current difficulties faced in several agricultural sectors, including the pig meat, dairy, and fruit and vegetable sectors. Around 100 farmers protested outside the meeting, which came just six months after the EU announced a 500-million-euro (554.24 million U.S. dollar) emergency package to tackle a crisis partly blamed on a Russian embargo. European farmers have been in a price crisis for nearly two years. A combination of factors, including the abolishment of milk quotas, slowing market demand, and a Russian embargo on Western products in response to sanctions over the Ukraine conflict, has pushed down prices for beef, pork and milk. The series of measures were outlined by EU's agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan. \"We must use the appropriate instruments and actions to enable farmers to be resilient in the face of volatility whilst providing immediate assistance to them,\" Hogan told the ministers. \"In the interest of EU farmers, I am prepared to use all instruments that the legislators have put at our disposal, both as a short-term and long-term measure,\" Hogan said. The EU said it would temporarily increase the amount of state aid. The union's regulators would allow member states to provide to a maximum of 15,000 euros per farmer per year and no national ceiling would apply. Meanwhile, the EU is doubling the intervention ceilings for skimmed milk powder and butter from 109,000 tonnes and 60,000 tonnes to 218,000 tonnes and 100,000 tonnes. The EU said it would mobilize over 110 million euros in 2016 to support the promotion of EU agricultural produce within the EU and in third countries. Over 30 million euros have been specifically earmarked for the pig meat and dairy sectors, a commitment made last September. Meanwhile, the EU planned to develop appropriate financial instruments with the European Investment Bank (EIB) or the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), to assist farmers. The investments from the financial instruments will improve the competitiveness of agricultural enterprises or accelerate the necessary structural adjustments, the EU said. In addition, the EU is considering a prolongation of the exceptional measures for fruit and vegetables arising from the Russian ban which expires on June 30. Extending the aid package for fruit and vegetables would require more funding. The European Commission, EU's chief executive body, has mobilized more than 1 billion euros to help farmers since the Russian ban was imposed. \"This is a package of measures which can have a material and positive impact on European agricultural markets and it should now be given the chance to succeed,\" Hogan said.

He questioned why the NPA pursued a disciplinary case against Breytenbach when there was no evidence. Kruger said that if the NPA and the National Director of Public Prosecutions  (NDPP) \"end up favouring and fearing politicians instead of the law\" the criminal justice system would fail to function without prejudice. \"This would leave those who should be criminally charged going free and those who question the former, being persecuted -- possibly without an iota of evidence,\" he said. \"The rationality, legality, and constitutionality of the NPA's conduct -- its ability to fulfil its constitutional duty without fear, favour, or prejudice -- are up for review in a number of matters.\" Breytenbach was found not guilty on 15 counts on Monday by a disciplinary hearing which sat at the NPA's head office in Pretoria. \"The guilt of the employee on this plethora of charges has not been established,\" said the hearing's chairman Selby Mbenenge SC. Breytenbach was also found not guilty on any of the alternative charges. A core charge against the anti-graft prosecutor was failing to act impartially when investigating the Kumba Iron Ore\/Sishen and Imperial Crown Trading mining rights issue, because of \"improper relations\" with Sishen's lawyer Mike Hellens. Other charges included \"surreptitiously leaking\" NPA inside information to Beeld journalist Sonja Carstens; giving her official NPA laptop to her lawyer; and \"maligning\" the NPA in the media. Breytenbach was suspended from the NPA on April 30, 2012. She claimed acting NDPP Nomgcobo Jiba suspended her to stop her from prosecuting former police crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli on fraud and other charges. In March, a parallel arbitration hearing at the Public Service Bargaining Council, in Centurion, found Breytenbach's suspension was both procedurally and  substantively fair.

On education matters, Zuma seemed to hold teachers' right to strike above such questions as whether schools would receive textbooks for the year.  Another important question was and whether the annual national assessments and matric results of 2012 provided a reliable indication of the state of education. \"... More so in the case of South Africa, where approximately a third of the  population is under the age of 15,\" said Bailey. On the issue of crime, Bailey said Zuma attributed reduced crime statistics to improvements in the SA Police Service, but failed to acknowledge the roles of private security companies and community safety initiatives. \"While the country needs three private security people for every member of the police to achieve such a minuscule decrease in crime percentages, there is no reason for self-congratulation.\" In order for the cycle of corruption to be broken, convicted officials enjoying political favour should not be redeployed in other government or semi-government institutions.  \"Perpetrators have to be held accountable and will have to forfeit the right  to certain appointments after having been found guilty,\" Bailey said.  She said Zuma's comments about addressing unemployment were laudable, but that the private sector needed to be stimulated to create more jobs.  \"It would have been much more fitting to investigate ways in which public spending can become more efficient and how a sustainable tax basis can be created that would stimulate the growth of the private sector maximally.\" AfriForum found Zuma's stance on land reform particularly disconcerting. Zuma said the government would drop the \"willing-buyer, willing seller\" principle, which forced the state to pay more for land, in favour of the \"just and equitable principle for compensation, as set out in the Constitution\". \"No mention is made of the fact that this lack of progress is due to the state's maladministration,\" Bailey said. \"Thus, the dangerous perception is created that the slow pace of reform is due to the unwilling, greedy nature of landowners.\" In this regard, Zuma had done little to reassure South Africans and foreign investors about the future of private property rights, which was essential for a successful economy.  Rather, the state-of-the-nation address emphasised the importance of civil society's role in resolving South Africa's problems.  Sapa \/mjs\/clh","label":0}

The secrecy surrounding the plans has led many people to question whether the plans exist, especially since the Act states that communities should be informed of their contents. However, officials were adamant that plans for all possible disasters existed but would only be disclosed to communities when necessary. The issue came to a head after last year's explosion at the Island View Storage complex and the fire at the Engen refinery on the Bluff. The Mercury reported that residents affected in both incidents were outraged because they claimed that there was no guidance on what to do or where to go, and that there was no clear direction from the municipality. The newspaper further reported that the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA) had made use of the Promotion of Access to Information Act to attempt to view these plans, but that the request  was refused. Alliance chairman Desmond D'Sa said the municipality gave permission  for two members of the organisation to view the plans, but on condition  that the contents were not disclosed. The organisation declined the offer. The organisation is now thinking of taking legal action to force the  municipality to make the evacuation plans available. City manager Mike Sutcliffe told the newspaper that it was not possible to have a generic plan with directions and evacuation routes for affected communities. He said several elements needed to be taken into consideration because \"just as there are thousands of incidents that could happen, there are thousands of ways to deal with them\". He said that in the event of a disaster, a senior official would assess the situation and make recommendations to deal with the situation. Sutcliffe said people should stay in their homes in the event of a serious incident and listen to their radio for updates and instructions. Sapa","label":0}

Wambach, the leading goal scorer of all time, will cover the European Championships in France and the Rio Olympics in August. But her role won't be limited to soccer: She will work across multiple platforms including ESPN Films and shows including \"Outside the Lines,\" according to the network. \"Talking and reporting on thing that I'm passionate about really, really was the selling point to me,\" Wambach told The Associated Press. \"Because I don't want the rest of my life to be based on the fact that I played soccer. I want to be able to venture and learn about different things.\" Wambach also will produce a podcast, \"Fearless Conversation with Abby Wambach,\" which she promises won't shy away from controversy. Among her first topics will be foreign players on the U.S. national team. Wambach drew criticism when she blasted U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann for bringing in \"a bunch of these foreign guys\" in December. Oslo-born midfielder Mix Diskerud subsequently posted a message to Wambach on Instagram. \"I know we're not quite equal. From 'your group of people' the country's Commander in Chief need to be selected.

To be quite honest, it's been few and far between in my career, the reason being that I've been speaking for 23 other women, so I kind of towed the party line during that time.\" Wambach, the FIFA Player of the Year in 2012, scored 184 career goals, more than any other player, male or female. She played 15 years with the U.S. women's national team. She capped her career last summer with the sport's most prestigious championship when the United States defeated Japan 5-2 in Canada at the World Cup. It was the third World Cup title for the U.S. women and first since 1999. Wambach appeared in four World Cups with the national team. She also has a pair of Olympic gold medals, from the 2004 Games in Athens and the 2012 Games in London. She did not compete in the Beijing Games because of a broken leg. Wambach announced her retirement in October and played her final match in December. Since she stepped away from the team, she has made several appearances at charity events and campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. During the course of her career, Wambach has been active in fighting for equal rights for female athletes. She led a group of players in protest of FIFA's decision to play the 2015 World Cup on artificial turf, which is considered by many to be inferior to grass. She made headlines last month when she was pulled over for driving under the influence in Portland, Oregon, where she lives. After posting a public apology on her Facebook page, she pleaded guilty and entered a diversion program for first-time offenders.","label":0}

Wiese, along with a large contingent of board and management, was briefing three parliamentary committees. Acting board chairwoman Heather Sonn told MPs they were constrained legally in what they could say in public, but revealed that the company had reported the former chief executive Markus Jooste to the Directorate for Priority Investigation, more commonly known as the Hawks in South Africa. Jooste resigned shortly after news broke of the scandal. Wiese said he became aware of the accounting irregularities days before it was confirmed in early December. He was at pains to point out that the auditors who pointed out the irregularities in the 2017 financial statements had been the same company \"paid handsomely\" to do previous audits, the integrity of which are also now been questioned. Chairman of the supervisory board's audit committee Steve Booysen said, while initial reports of fraud at Steinhoff being investigated by German authorities surfaced in September last year, irregularities were only confirmed in December. Jooste was asked to make a presentation to explain certain transactions and \"more importantly the cash flow of certain transactions\", said Booysen. \"Markus Jooste then did send an sms text message to me as audit chairman and the content of the sms really led me to the conclusion that that is confirmation of the accounting irregularities and then he later offered that evening to make his presentation for which he didn't pitch up...\" Booysen said Jooste tendered his resignation at 19h45 that same evening.

Founded in 2003, TNK-BP is jointly owned by BP and Alfa-Access-Renova. It has been facing growing pressure in Russia, where the state has reasserted control in the lucrative oil and gas industries. Representatives of the Alfa-Access-Renova consortium met Thursday with BP officials and members of TNK-BP's board of directors who represent the British oil major. During the meetings, the \"members of the consortium informed BP of their position demanding that TNk-BP's president and chief executive officer, Robert Dudley, to resign, as Mr Dudley is managing the company  in the interest of only one shareholder, that is BP,\" the statement said. The Russian consortium also stressed the importance that \"the disagreements between the shareholders on the need to name an independent president and CEO do not affect the activities and cooperative management of TNK-BP.\" The Russian shareholders also expressed concern about Dudley's public statements about disagreements within the company. In an interview published in the Moscow daily Vedomosti on Monday Dudley acknowledged disagreements between TNK-BP's shareholders, in particular on development strategy and management methods. He also did not exclude the possibility that TNK-BP, Russia's third biggest oil producer, might see a slide in output in 2008. Russian police raided BP's office earlier this month, and officers from Russia's Federal Security Service raided the offices of BP and TNK-BP in March, charging one TNK-BP employee who holds Russian and US citizenship with industrial espionage. TNK-BP is also currently being challenged in the Russian courts by a  minority shareholder for allegedly harming the company's interests by hiring foreign specialists from BP.

Former SAA chief financial officer Tryphosa Ramano will serve as deputy chairwoman. The rest of the 12-person board are Bajabulile Tshabalala, Thandeka Mgoduso, economist Nazmeera Moola, Akhter Hoosen Moosa, Gugu Sepamla, Siphile Buthelezi, former ANC MP Peter Maluleka, former print media director Mzimkulu Malunga, Martha Mbatha and attorney Peter Tshisevhe. Myeni's tenure has been widely seen as one of the key battles between President Jacob Zuma, to whom she is close, and National Treasury after she sought to defy the latter's warnings last year not to renegotiate a contract with Airbus as it could trigger onerous penalties. The board was finally named six months after Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said, hours before he delivered the national budget in February, that he would move to appoint a new one to resolve the financial woes of the troubled national carrier. The Cabinet statement commended Gordhan for his efforts to restore confidence in the South African economy while aiming a blow at him for making public statements on the manner in which the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) were conducting their investigation into an intelligence unit within the revenue service. Gordhan this week, through his lawyers, reproached the Hawks for seeking to humiliate him. \"Cabinet expressed its concern over continued public spats between various parties on the matter related to the Hawks investigation into SARS-related issues. Cabinet called on all those concerned, including members of Cabinet acting in various capacities, to exercise restraint and cease making public statements directed at any protagonist in this matter. \"Cabinet calls on all parties to act with dignity and decorum and to respectfully approach the relevant parties instead of taking to public platforms.\" It added: \"Cabinet joins President Zuma in expressing full confidence in the Minister of Finance who ... has been doing a sterling job in building confidence in our economy among domestic and foreign investors.\" But the statement also urged \"all parties to respect and cooperate with state organs tasked with law enforcement\" in another tacit jab at Gordhan who last week refused to comply when the Hawks summoned him to their offices. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Benchmark oil for November delivery was down 41 cents to $103.69 per barrel at midday Bangkok time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. A report from the American Petroleum Institute showed an increase in oil supplies for the week ending Sept. 27. Stocks rose by 356,000 barrels to 363.7 million barrels from the prior week, suggesting a weakening in demand. The price of oil rose the most in two weeks Wednesday, on the prospect of more oil shipping between a key U.S. Midwest hub and the Gulf Coast. The contract jumped $2.06, or 2 percent, to close at $104.10 on the Nymex on Wednesday. Reports said that Transcanada is close to completing work on the southern portion of its Keystone pipeline expansion. That could mean as much as 700,000 barrels a day moving out of Cushing, Oklahoma, the pricing point for U.S. benchmark oil. The additional demand is likely to boost oil prices all else held equal. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price imported crude used by many U.S. refineries, fell 25 cents to $108.94 in London. In other energy futures trading on Nymex: - Wholesale gasoline was almost unchanged at $2.63 per gallon. - Natural gas rose 0.4 cent to $3.546 per 1,000 cubic feet. - Heating oil fell 0.3 cent to $2.99 per gallon.

Salga chairman Thabo Manyoni was commenting on the outcomes of the National Council of Provinces local government week. Municipalities were operating in a space where finances were tight because of the global economic crisis, and where urbanisation was happening at a rapid pace. \"People get more into debt.... The majority of people who are coming into cities, they don't have skills,\" said Manyoni. \"Those who are earning less than R3000, for instance, are people who are spending more on food and transport rather than on shelter, and also on bettering the general conditions of their lives.\" This meant people could not sustain themselves, and it resulted in municipalities themselves battling to remain sustainable because they were not receiving the funds they expected through rates and taxes. The problem of limited resources was twofold. \"The challenge of resources in terms of human and also capital... human in the sense of having skills and having citizenry who are skilled to sustain themselves, but also municipalities having the necessary skills to address challenges by stimulating the economy and maintaining infrastructure,\" Manyoni said. Salga said an active citizenry, combined with good leadership, was key to making municipalities operate more successfully. \"People should also get involved in trying to better their lives instead of always having a citzenry that will always be passive, always expecting delivery.... It's an issue of culture.\" The political leadership at municipal level needed urgent improvement. \"I'm referring to political leadership who are interested in the areas in which they are meant to be operating, that is encouraging, that is meeting people instead of outsourcing those political functions and making sure we build communities that are understanding and able to take charge of their lives,\" Manyoni said. He said the lines of communication between municipalities and citizens were not open, which was one of the main causes of spiralling service delivery protests. \"Local government does not communicate adequately. We don't talk to each other, we talk across each other,\" he said. \"Those citizens... they must be able to understand what are the limitations what are the challenges facing local government and I think that will assist in minimising protests.\" Sapa \/cp\/hdw\/ks\/clh","label":0}

We are of the  opinion that a donation is a donation. We don't think we owe anybody.\" Klopper confirmed that the ANC had been paid in the region of R24 million, as reported by the Sunday Times. According to the newspaper's report, the trustees were demanding:  -- R2.4 million from the ANC Western Cape; -- R750,000 from the ANC Eastern Cape; -- R6 million from the ANC Youth League; -- R14 million from Lunga Ncwana, a prominent member of the youth league; and -- R860,000 from Songezo Mjongile, a member of the league?s national executive committee. Skwatsha however said that the sum in question was \"less than R1  million\" and had been used to pay the party's utility bills. \"The ANC keeps no money. That... donation was given to us when our electricity and telephones were cut, we used that to pay the bills. We are happy that he helped us.\" According to the Sunday Times the youth league?s Ncwana had told  the trustees he used part half of the R14 million to buy two properties in Cape Town, one for himself at Constantia Kloof, for R4.7 million, and the other for his mother in Newlands, for R1.2 million. Democratic Alliance spokesman James Selfe said on Sunday his party had been approached by the trustees and had repaid R250,000 that it had received. \"We were satisfied that the money had been received improperly and we have repaid the money in full and final settlement to the trustees.\" Sapa","label":0}

The levels of chromium and barium were so high that a European Union research team's instruments had been unable to take accurate measurements, Beeld reported. The team had spent two years gathering data from the coal-rich catchment area of the Olifants River to determine whether environmental and social offences were taking place.  A South African member of the team, Dr Henk Coetzee of the Council for Geoscience, told the newspaper the EU was very aware of environmental legislation, human rights and sustainable development. It had increasingly been hearing concerned voices from South Africa about coal mines encroaching on neighbourhoods and protected areas.  French geologist Stephane Chevrel, who led the project, reportedly said the EU and Israel had allocated about R48 million for the research.

The greenback lost ground against the yen but recouped most losses against other currencies. The single European currency at 2100 GMT was at 1.4227 dollars against 1.4229 late Friday in New York. At one point, however, the euro  jumped to 1.4481 dollars. The US unit was weaker against the Japanese currency, at 104.89 yen after 107.92 on Friday. Stuart Bennett of investment bank Calyon said the dollar's slide earlier Monday in Asian trade may have been \"a short-term reaction\" reflecting investor unease at the collapse of Lehman Brothers and emergency sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America. But the dollar later strengthened as turmoil in the US financial sector prompted investors to take risk-averse positions that favored the US currency. \"It is likely that the spike in risk aversion will fuel further deleveraging and US repatriation flows, helping to provide some support  for the dollar and limiting (the) downside for the dollar in the near-term,\" said Lee Hardman of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Analysts noted that although the financial crisis originated in the United States, the dollar is still perceived as a refuge in times of turmoil, which explains its gradual strengthening against the euro since mid-July. Investors also appear to believe that the US economy will be better able to withstand the impact of financial market unrest than those in Asia and Europe. The dollar last Thursday soared to a 12-month high of 1.3882 against  the euro on gloomy prospects for eurozone economic momentum. But the turmoil stemming from Lehman Brothers and other financial firms sparked renewed talk that the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday, could lower rates to calm market turmoil. Analysts said that the futures market was pricing in a 64 percent chance of a quarter-point cut in the funds rate, currently at 2.0 percent. Terri Belkas, currency strategist at Forex Capital Markets, said the  Fed decision is a key.  \"Will they reduce rates and more importantly, how will the meeting impact the US dollar this week?\" Stephen Malyon at ScotiaFX said Federal Reserve inflation hawks \"will be aghast at the prospect of further monetary stimulus, although such a step certainly can't be ruled out.\" Still, Malyon said the US unit \"is holding up very well considering the source of all the turmoil, speculation surrounding the Fed and signs that a long-awaited correction from overbought levels was underway on Friday.\" In late New York trade, the dollar stood at 1.1159 Swiss francs from  1.1293 Friday.

The DA was reacting to an investigation of alleged unprofessional conduct by a Bloemfontein pathologist who put \"Aids\"  on a death certificate as a cause of death of a young woman. \"It is important that this hearing be conducted, because the Council has often faced complaints that it is simply there to protect doctors,\" DA spokesman on health, Gareth Morgan, said. \"The outcome will be very important for South Africa, because it  will force us to at last confront the conflict between confidentiality and awareness that we have been tiptoeing around since the epidemic began,\" he said in a statement. Morgan said in the process of conducting this disciplinary hearing, the party hoped that those involved would consider that current policies that protected the confidentiality of Aids patients at all costs may not be helping the national Aids awareness campaign. He said in the light of new vigour in the war on Aids, after \"the effective demotion of the Health Minister,\" and the long-awaited availability of effective treatment, it might be necessary to re-examine confidentiality policies and adapt them slightly. Morgan said the disclosure of an unknown HIV infection to family  members of a dead patient will inevitably come as a shock. \"But it is possible to argue that it is better that they should know of the possible infection risk they face, and therefore be able to be tested and if necessary receive treatment, than remain uninformed.\" Morgan said possibly doctors should be given the leeway to use their judgement, on the basis of certain guidelines, about how to describe the cause of death.

A company had been appointed to audit leave, and Statistics SA had been assigned do a headcount. In March 2011, the government placed the Eastern Cape education department under administration because of inefficiency and maladministration. Motshekga said four main problems had led to the intervention: finance, transport, school nutrition, and teacher deployment. Progress had been made in fixing the problems. She said the provincial department had appointed a new head of department and a chief financial officer. More than 2300 part-time teachers had been fully  employed, and more teachers would be hired. An amount of R130 million had been made available by the province for rural allowances to encourage teachers to work in these areas. Auditing companies were helping to sort out the books and these teams would remain for some time for the transfer of skills. \"From the report which I got from the accountants... we may not be able to get a clean audit this year because there are a lot of challenges.\" Motshekga said the department intended replacing 510 mud schools with proper  facilities.

Someone, somewhere, must be so depraved and hateful that liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans could join in common cause to vilify them. They appear to have found their target: sex offenders. The current case in point is a congressional proposal to alert the nations of the world that particular U.S. citizens who have committed sex offenses against minors are planning to visit. Passports would be specially marked so that other countries could turn travelers away at the border because of old crimes for which they have already served their time in the U.S. This vindictive bill has been wisely rejected numerous times in the past, but now it's heading to President Obama's desk. He should veto it. Sex offenses against minors are particularly horrendous crimes. But when offenders have completed their sentences and periods of supervision, there is no more reason to continue hounding and harassing them than convicted murderers or drug traffickers, who don't bear scarlet letters on their passports. But wait, some supporters argue, people who commit sex crimes against children are a special case. As soon as they've done it once, they'll want more, posing imminent danger to any underage person anywhere. Their front doors should be marked to warn trick-or-treaters. They should be banned from park benches. This blatantly false argument thrives on ignorance. There are indeed mentally disordered sex offenders whose conditions make them extremely high risks to commit more crimes of the same variety. Some may target minors. But that is far different from saying that anyone convicted of a sex offense against a minor falls into that very narrow category. Corrections officials in California report that most sexual crimes committed by adults against minors occur among family members, and that the rate of recidivism is fairly low. Sex offenders, sex traffickers, sexual predators \u2014 these terms are now routinely conflated by some of the same people who now apologize for waging the war on drugs and who favor efforts to \"ban the box,\" which would eliminate questions about convictions on employment applications. They would be wise to put down their torches and pitchforks, put on their thinking caps, and remember the value of punishment that fits the crime and allows perpetrators who no longer pose a threat to move on when their debt to society has been paid. Online: http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/ ____ Jan. 30 The Chicago Sun-Times on Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio's stances on immigration: You'd never know it from their sound bites during debates and on the campaign trail for the Republican presidential nomination, but less than three years ago Cuban American Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio supported the legalization of millions of undocumented immigrants. Cruz has denied it. Rubio, meanwhile, distances himself from legalization and a path to citizenship that was outlined in a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill he co-authored with seven other U.S. senators in 2013. They no doubt worry their past support for common-sense reform could be a death sentence to their presidential aspirations at a time when national front-runner Donald Trump has turned the primary season upside down. Lessons learned from Republican Mitt Romney's failed presidential bid in 2012 \u2014 when he alienated Latinos during the primaries \u2014 are being ignored as Cruz and Rubio try to compete with Trump for the title of most conservative on immigration. All three continue to yank the Republican Party further and further from mainstream America. That's bad for the GOP and bad for the nation. In 2013, Cruz favored legalizing undocumented immigrants without offering a path to citizenship. He proposed an amendment to Rubio's bill for just that reason. Yet, weeks ago he said he never supported legalization. Pushed for clarification in later weeks, he said his amendment was proposed in an attempt to kill the legislation. In Thursday's Fox News debate, Cruz was reminded of what he actually said when moderator Megyn Kelly asked him to watch a video clip. \"I don't want immigration reform to fail,\" Cruz said in 2013. \"I want immigration reform to pass. I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically. \"I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.\" That's the Ted Cruz that advocates for immigration reform who worked with him during George W. Bush's presidency remember. \"My criticism is that Cruz can say, 'Things have changed and I've changed my position.' But don't sit here and flat out lie that you've never been for legalization when the facts are very clear,\" Robert De Posada, former director of Hispanic affairs for the Republican National Committee, told the Daily Beast. Rubio, on the other hand, should be proud that he helped to craft an immigration bill heavy on compromise in 2013. The Senate passed the bill; it was never called in the Republican-controlled House. Since then Rubio has backpedaled from it. Like other members of his party, Rubio is not sure where he should be on immigration. During his 2010 campaign for Senate, he told voters he did not support citizenship for undocumented immigrants or their legalization. During the debate Fox News aired some of his comments from that campaign, in which he equated citizenship to amnesty. Cornered by the moderators, Rubio switched his focus to the Islamic State and border security. He and other candidates fail to mention that the undocumented population has dipped every year since 2008, according to the Center for Migration Studies. As for border security, Rubio's bill had allocated billions for it. Finally, Rubio came around to say he would not deport 12 million undocumented immigrants (the Center for Migration Studies says the number fell to below 11 million in 2014). \"We will see what the American people are willing to support,\" he said of legalization and a path to citizenship. What you haven't heard from Trump, Cruz and Rubio is that most of America \u2014 72 percent, according to the most recent survey by the Pew Research Center \u2014 believes that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to remain in this country legally as long as they meet other requirements. You can bet that if Rubio or Cruz (or Trump) win the nomination, they'll point out that percentage to get conservatives to soften their hard line on immigration and to win over moderates. Romney tried that in 2012. After aligning himself with Arizona's tough immigration policies during the primary season, Romney tried to come back to middle America for the general election. How did that turn out? Online: http:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/ ____ Feb. 3 The New York Times on the Zika virus: The World Health Organization and its director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, were right to declare the Zika virus an international public health emergency, even if its suspected link to severe birth defects has not been proved. The mosquito-borne disease is a serious threat: It is usually so mild as to be undetectable in adults, yet as it has exploded across South and Central America it has been followed by a surge in babies born with underdeveloped heads, a condition called microcephaly. The emergency designation will galvanize coordinated international monitoring and action of the sort that was tragically missing in the first months of the Ebola pandemic. The W.H.O.'s decision, however, could reduce travel to affected countries, which would be an economic burden. Brazil, where Zika made its first major appearance in the Western Hemisphere last May, is especially fearful that visitors will stay away from the Olympic Games in August. It cannot let that prevent it from being completely transparent about this serious threat and the steps it is taking to protect people. In Latin America, where many nations outlaw abortion, some governments have advised that pregnancies be delayed, which can create only greater anxiety for women who have sadly limited control over such decisions. All of this adds urgency to the work of medical researchers investigating any possible link between microcephaly and Zika infection, for which there is no cure. And it puts a heavy responsibility on the W.H.O. and institutions like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pan American Health Organization to give clear and realistic guidance on how to avoid infection. The C.D.C. has issued a list of countries pregnant women should try to avoid visiting and has advised travelers on how to protect against mosquito bites. Fighting Zika will not be easy. Like Ebola, it is nurtured by heat, humidity and poverty, conditions that can be intensified by globalization and global warming. Unlike Ebola, Zika is primarily spread by a mosquito, the Aedes aegypti, which is rampant in hot climates. The risk of a major outbreak in the United States is low because of effective mosquito-control programs and air-conditioning. A vaccine or an effective treatment is still a long way off. Immediate responses, like increasing access to birth control and abortion, face stiff legal and cultural resistance in the affected region. That leaves mosquito control as the most effective weapon available now. One method being tried in Brazil is to release Aedes mosquitoes that are genetically modified to produce self-destroying offspring. These and other measures should gain momentum now that Zika has been declared an emergency. That is essential not only to protect women and their babies, but also for improving the global response to other obscure germs waiting their turn in some hot, humid place. Online: http:\/\/www.nytimes.com ____ Feb. 2 The Wall Street Journal on South Korea's labor market: South Korea ranks 121 out of 140 countries in labor-market flexibility, according to the World Economic Forum. As in Japan, South Korean workers expect lifetime employment, annual pay hikes and seniority-based promotion when they join a company. So it's progress that Seoul's Labor Ministry adopted guidelines last week making it easier for companies to fire poor performers and revise employment rules. Employers heretofore couldn't fire subpar workers for anything short of a disciplinary violation. The guidelines also free companies from securing majority approval from employees before amending employment rules, as long as the revision is \"reasonable\" according to various standards. Officials also want to accelerate the adoption of a wage peak system that allows reduced wages to workers nearing retirement. Seoul hopes the system will lessen payroll costs as the retirement age rises to 60 this year, and encourage the hiring of younger workers. President Park Geun-hye has made labor reform a priority to reinvigorate the economy. GDP growth has dipped to 2.6%, its slowest in three years. Youth joblessness is at a 16-year high, and Korean exports are growing more slowly than at any time since the financial crisis. Ms. Park brokered a landmark agreement with business leaders and one of two major labor unions in September, offering a revision in five labor laws. But the bills have been stalled since December after the opposition party refused to vote ahead of April's legislative elections. Ms. Park's implementation of the new guidelines shows her determination to press ahead. The guidelines aren't legally binding but will be used by ministry officials to supervise labor and management relations. The Federation of Korean Trade Unions, which backed out of Ms. Park's negotiations, says the new guidelines violate labor laws. But the guidelines will remain effective until a court rules on the labor challenge, which could take years. Contrast this to rival Japan, where workers waste time in \"boredom\" rooms because they can't be fired. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised labor reform but abandoned a bill on merit pay to pass a controversial national security law. Seoul has already surpassed Tokyo in embracing free trade. Agreements with the European Union and the U.S. have been in effect since 2012, adding an estimated $48 billion in annual Korean exports. Korea's unions are still loud but their political clout is waning. Union membership is down by about half from its peak in 1989 due to the increase in nonregular and small-firm employees. Ms. Park's conservative Saenuri Party is expected to maintain its legislative majority in April's elections, so union influence is likely to decline farther. More flexible labor policies would raise productivity and wages at home, as well as make Korean goods more competitive in global markets. It's in the best interest of workers if labor leaders return to the negotiating table with Ms. Park. Online: ____ Feb. 1 The Seattle Times on campaign ads: Television watchers need to brace themselves for the worst this election season. Hundreds of millions of dollars are likely to be poured into political ads narrated by ominous voices and designed to influence voters' ballot choices. Some commercials, paid for by campaigns, will conclude with candidates saying they approve the message. Viewers should be extra skeptical of any ads brought to them by independent political action committees with benign sounding names like Priorities USA Action, Believe Again, Unintimidated PAC and Right to Rise USA. Such names reveal nothing about who the true sponsors of the advertisements really are. The Federal Communications Commission, which seems to turn a blind eye, should require more transparency and has the authority to do so: . Section 315 of the Communications Act requires broadcast stations to identify sponsors of political ads in files available for public viewing. Not every station is complying, according to extensive research by civic watchdog groups, such as the Sunlight Foundation, the Campaign Legal Center and Common Cause. . Section 317 requires advertisers and broadcasters to disclose to viewers and listeners the \"true identity\" of the person, group or entity paying for a political ad. Many don't, and the FCC has failed to enforce this rule. Last week, 168 Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives signed a letter urging FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to quickly require that broadcasters reveal the names of political-ad sponsors on the air. According to OpenSecrets.org, conservative groups by far dominate this type of campaign advertising. Democracy is weakened when influence over the public airwaves is controlled by dark-money groups, whether on the right or the left, which have the power to raise and spend unlimited funds. Citizens have a right to know when and why mega-rich individuals, such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the industrialist Koch brothers, pour their wealth into advocacy. That's why the FCC must do more as a regulator to restore trust in American democracy by ensuring campaign commercials are more transparent. Online: http:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/ ____ Feb. 3 The Khaleej Times on refugee influx in Jordan: Jordan is at the crossroads as it copes with the refugee exodus and simmering tensions in the region. King Abdullah has rightly said that the Hashemite Kingdom is now at a 'boiling point' as 635,000 Syrian refugees are on its soil. \"Sooner or later, I think, the dam is going to burst,\" he warned policy-makers ahead of a donor conference on Syria in London. This is in addition to the Palestinian diaspora, which for long has been a burden on its resources. The Gulf War also saw Iraqis spilling into Jordan, and many of them have not returned home. The world community should focus its attention towards the woes that Amman faces as pressure mounts on its social services, economy and demography. Jordan could soon have more foreigners than citizens on its soil. Militant organizations pose a threat and misuse the country's porous international borders. Government statistics say that 25 per cent of the state budget is spent in helping refugees. Amman is in need of hard cash to fund aid operations and settlement schemes for Syrians in distress. Its earlier SOS messages to the world body to finance similar humanitarian projects had fallen on deaf ears. Its economic crunch and security concerns should be taken seriously. Jordan is an important partner in anti-terrorism operations and, of late, had been training Libyan rebels and other security personnel from a host of regional countries. Which is why the Hashemite kingdom should be supported ito tackle the flood of refugees. If Jordan decides to limit its humanitarian response, it could lead to further unrest in the region.

Malinao MANILA, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- In any major undertaking, especially if it involves countries with different economic structures and stages of development, there is bound to be different views and expectations. While the Philippine government is enthusiastic about the benefits that the country can get from the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by yearend, the private sector has expressed some doubts. The AEC, as envisioned by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), will strengthen intra-regional trade and the free flow of capital, goods, skilled labor and services within the regional grouping's 10 member countries. In a statement issued in September, Secretary Gregory Domingo of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the main agency tasked with implementing the Philippine participation in AEC, said that the country is \"well-positioned\" for the integration. Domingo said that the country's stable economic performance, along with the various reforms it implemented, has put the Philippines in a good position to benefit from the economic integration. \"The country is in a sweet spot. We have been experiencing robust economic growth, consistent upward rankings in competitiveness, and successive credit rating upgrades,\" Domingo said. He said that what the Philippines needs is to improve its competitiveness and the capability of its local industries to fully benefit from the AEC. But Domingo's rosy projections, representing that of the Philippine government, are not shared by the private sector. Manuel Pangilinan, a Filipino business tycoon, said on Monday that the Philippines is not yet ready for economic integration with the rest of ASEAN. In an interview with the Philippine Star, a leading Manila daily newspaper, Pangilinan admitted that while regional economic integration would definitely happen \"it will not happen in our lifetime\" because of politics. Pangilinan, who chairs three giant Philippine corporations, namely the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Metro Pacific Investments Corp., and the Manila Electric Co., said that under the AEC, the Philippines would face tougher competitions from other ASEAN members. He cited sugar, which is one of the Philippines' main agricultural products. \"It is cheaper to import sugar and this will be good for Filipino consumers but this will displace four million people from their jobs,\" Pangilinan said. He said that any sitting Philippine president cannot allow 4 million Filipinos to go hungry. \"It will be suicide,\" Pangilinan said. Nestor Tan, president of the BDO Unibank, Inc., the country's largest bank, also told a recent business forum that while the Philippines is an attractive market, it has no means to compete with other developed ASEAN countries. Tan said he is worried that Philippine banks are not ready to compete with the bigger banks of neighboring ASEAN countries when the AEC is fully operational. According to Tan, ASEAN integration could have a downside for the region, particularly to the banking industry. \"For banks, we expect heavier requirements, the byproduct of global standards,\" he said. But Benjamin Diokno, economics professor of the University of the Philippines, said that the AEC could further push forward the country's economic growth due to higher demand for local products in the ASEAN market. In his recent column in one of Manila's business daily, Diokno said that the increased labor mobility in the ASEAN market could provide more job opportunities for Filipinos, which might ease up the serious unemployment at home and further increase remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). Diokno, a former budget secretary, said that the Philippines has an advantage in the service sector because of its huge supply of English-speaking workforce. \"At the same time, business firms might be attracted to locate in the Philippines because of the big pool of English-speaking labor supply,\" Diokno said. Founded in 1967, ASEAN groups 10 countries at varying levels of development, namely Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It offers a growing consumer market of more than 600 million people. Its gross domestic product (GDP) reached 2.57 trillion U.S. dollars in 2014. Enditem","label":0}

The third ODI on Tuesday at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch might be a dead rubber, but there are enough reasons for Windies to try and make something out of it. This year, of the 21 ODIs they have played, Windies have won just three and lost as many as 15, three games ending without a result. In the second match, Windies had folded for 121 inside 28 overs after letting New Zealand post 325 for 6 despite having it down to 186 for 5 at one stage. New Zealand's batsmen have dominated in both the matches to date. George Worker, who has replaced the injured Martin Guptill, struck half-centuries in both games to give the hosts a solid platform. Henry Nicholls, Ross Taylor and Todd Astle have also been among the runs. Worker, along with Colin Munro, will once again open the innings and look to continue to impress, what with Guptill expected to take back his opening spot once he recovers from his hamstring injury. \"I'm trying not to think about that side of selection too much,\" Worker pointed out. \"Obviously, Martin is going to come back in and I'm just going out there and approaching it as normal. It's just been really enjoyable to be back in the side and I'm trying to make the most of it.\" Worker used an ice pack on his right foot right after training, but confirmed it was only a minor strain and shouldn't come in the way of him making his seventh ODI appearance. In the bowling department, New Zealand has understandably relied on pace to do the damage. Doug Bracewell bagged four wickets in the first game, and it was Trent Boult who rattled the visitor with career-best figures of 7 for 34 in the second. Stuart Law, the Windies coach, revealed that Chris Gayle was recovering well from a viral infection that had kept him out of the second match, and could return for the final encounter. Beaton, technically still allowed to bowl in international cricket till he undergoes a test on his action and the results are revealed, is reportedly suffering from a side strain, which means he and Kesrick Williams, who is nursing a hamstring injury, are expected to be missing in action on Tuesday.

He went into the third round trailing by a single shot behind Kim on 11-under and eventually took over the top spot after Kim shot two-over-par on Thursday. \"I'm 13-under now and I'm very happy about it,\" De Villiers said after his round. \"It was a miserable day today. It was really tough. The wind made it very tricky trying to commit to a shot and getting them close. And with the wet greens, they pick up the sand and make judging the speed a bit tricky but they were still running true, so I'm chuffed with my round,\" he said. In such weather conditions, a two-under-par score is respectable and De Villiers maintains that with the score he has posted for the week, there will be no reason for him to either attack or play safely in the final round. \"The game plan tomorrow is pretty much the same,\" he said. \"The aim is to just hit fairways and greens. I'm not really going to let the other guys bother me. I'll just be sticking to my own thing and see what happens. If it produces a win, I'm very happy.\" Making moving day count was veteran Bradford Vaughan who has won three times in Swaziland before. He posted the lowest score of the round as he powered to a seven-under-par 65 third round which catapulted him to a share of second with Aubrey Beckley on 11-under. A bogey on 15, which was his sixth hole, spoiled what could have been a flawless round for the 42-year old. Beckley, on the other hand, shot a perfect six-under-66 while Kim's two-over par saw him drop from 12-under par for the week to 10-under and leave him fourth on the leaderboard. NJ Arnoldi occupies fifth on nine-under while Duane Keun, Ruan Conradie, Swazi amateur James Pennington, Herman Loubser and Coert Groenewald are in a share of sixth on eight-under-par. With things so tight at the top of the leaderboard, the final round is sure to produce some of the best golf for the spectators and players alike.

He said the government was looking at various ways to support the banks, which included finding a loan \"from elsewhere.\" Cyprus has already secured a 2.5 billion euro ($3.2 billion) low-interest loan from Russia to cover its refinancing needs for this year. The recession-hit economy is struggling with record unemployment, austerity measures and trying to rein in a deficit twice the EU accepted limit of three percent of GDP. The government is committed to getting its bloated deficit to below 3 percent this year from 6.4 percent in 2011.

{"id":"5dc271f06c767a0017f2c83d","url":"SAPAI-f80fb3b6ba-96390.txt","text":"(PICTURES) Leaders of the 79-member African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) bloc of poor and developing nations opened a summit on Wednesday to  discuss trade and develop relations with the now bigger European Union, their largest donor and commercial partner. ACP members are worried that the European Union, now with 10 new  members, will seek to scale back its aid to poorer countries or scrap preferential trade treatment. Leading the call for a level playing field on trade, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano -- one of the seven heads of state attending the opening ceremony in Maputo -- said the ACP's future relations with the 25-member EU would have to be reworked. \"We would like to reiterate that future trade relations between the ACP and EU need to be negotiated on open and transparent ground  in which not only trade issues are considered but also other issues  like development and the transfer of technology. \"Confronted with the demands and the rules of multilateral trade, there is a need to adopt a new ACP-EU trade relations framework that is compatible with the new reality,\" he said. Founded in 1975, the ACP, which groups 48 sub-Saharan countries,  16 Caribbean nations including Cuba and 15 from the Pacific, has been concerned with the failure of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks. A WTO meeting in Cancun in Mexico last September, aimed at breathing life into moribund trade talks that were launched in 2001, flopped over disagreements on scrapping agricultural export subsidies in industrialised nations as demanded by developing countries. Michael Ahern, minister of trade of Ireland, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, sought to dispel concerns that the bigger 25-member EU would turn away from development. \"The extension of the EU will allow ACP countries to export to new markets,\" he said, adding that Brussels remained committed to funding and fighting poverty and HIV\/AIDS and trying to effect good  governance, peace and stability in the ACP nations. The EU points out that by disbursing aid between 2002 and 2007 to the tune of 13.5 billion euros (16 billion dollars), it is one of the largest international donors. \"Enlargement will allow the EU to strengthen its influence in the multilateral arena, especially in the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions\" to push the Millennium Development Goals for developing nations, Ahern said. The targets include halving by 2015 the number of people earning  less than one dollar a day, ensuring universal primary education, reducing child mortality by two-thirds and halving the number of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. The opening ceremony -- also attended by President Robert Mugabe  of Zimbabwe, Xanana Gusmao of East Timor, Botswana's Festus Mogae, Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo-Brazzaville, Marc Ravalomanana of Madagascar and Azali Assoumani of the Comores -- also highlighted the HIV\/AIDS pandemic ravaging many poor countries. Ahern spoke of the havoc AIDS was wreaking economically and socially -- a theme taken up by Fijian Prime Minister Laisena Qarase.  In sub-Saharan Africa around 26.6 million people are living with  HIV and AIDS, out of an estimated 40 million worldwide, according to UN estimates. But Qarase, whose country now hands over the presidency of the ACP to Mozambique, stressed that the main message of the club was: \"We would like the riches of the world to be distributed with fairness.\" Sapa-AFP","label":0}
{"id":"5dc271f06c767a0017f2c7e1","url":"SAPAI-79d75b25fd-91592.txt","text":"INDUSTRY By AOIFE WHITE De Beers Group managing director Gareth Penny called Monday on diamond traders in Europe, the U.S. and Israel to back Africa's efforts  to cut and polish its own gemstones. The head of the South African miner - which controls 40 percent of the world's diamond trade - said it was not altruism to stabilize the diamond business by creating jobs in African democracies. \"We don't embrace this out of some misguided enthusiasm or altruism,  we embrace it because it makes good business sense and because it's the  right thing to do,\" he said. People will not buy 'conflict diamonds' stained with blood nor will miners invest the billions of dollars needed to extract them, he said. \"We need a strong and stable set of producing companies if we have to maximize future supply. Producing and selling diamonds today in or from a country in chaos or worse, in conflict, is simply not an option,\" Penny said Africa's natural resources have enriched traders across the world and Penny called on the gemstone business in Antwerp, Tel Aviv and New York to fund and help train the infant industry, mostly based in South Africa and Botswana - which owns 15 percent of De Beers. \"Without the traditional cutting centers, these new cutting centers will not succeed,\" he said, promising they would also gain from new opportunities. Botswana mining ministry official Kago Moshashane said the country planned to create up to 3,000 jobs in the diamond processing industry. Antwerp, which once sparkled as the focus of the diamond cutting trade, has ceded its place to India's Mumbai which now cuts most of the  world's diamonds, many of them less costly small stones. Antwerp grew wealthy from Belgium's rule of the Congo but is now an important focus for diamond trading and finance. Antwerp World Diamond Centre's chief executive Freddy Hanard said Africa's desire to take more of the business did not pose a threat. \"If that contributes to greater wealth in Africa, I think we should certainly contribute. Antwerp has a lot of expertise and ... we can help them,\" he said. Nor should the rise of Africa pose a problem for Asia, Penny said, because African countries will have to find their own market niche. They will need \"vibrant low-cost cutting centers in India and China to process the volume of low-value rough which is simply not economic to cut in Africa.\" The De Beers chief was upbeat about Africa's future, saying the company was spending more than US{dollar}100 million (?71 million) every year to seek new mines, \"overwhelmingly in Africa and significantly in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Angola.\" Along with Sierra Leone and Liberia, oil-rich Angola is recovering from years of conflict that saw diamond wealth fuel the fighting, eventually leading to international efforts to outlaw the sale of illegally mined gemstones.

Democratic Alliance justice spokeswoman Glynnis Breytenbach expressed \"serious disquiet\" about the implications of Mkhwebane's instruction to Parliament's Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development in this regard. \"Clearly, her recommendation goes beyond what she is legally empowered to do and is indicative of her long-term plan to render the Public Protectors office ineffective,\" she said. \"The effect of the 'remedial action' would be to instruct the justice committee to promote the action, which in itself appears sinister and is a cause for great concern.\" Breytenbach said the DA would engage with the head of Parliament's legal services to seek confirmation that the instruction was illegal and to determine whether the legislature would oppose it. The Economic Freedom Fighters also voiced concern that Mkhwebane was exceeding her powers. \"The EFF questions the PP's constitutional wisdom and understanding because of her remedial action in which she instructs Parliament to amend the Constitution in relations to the role of the Reserve Bank. No matter how noble her proposed amendment maybe, she has no power to instruct a constitutional amendment,\" EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said. \"The danger with her Constitutional amendment recommendation is that it will be refuted by the court. This will result in a general distrust in her capacity to take decisions that can stand the test of judicial review.\" Mkhwebane on Monday said the Reserve Bank had failed in its duties to protect the public by not ensuring that Absa Bank repaid an apartheid-era bailout given to failed bank Bankorp. She went on to recommend an amendment to section 224 of the constitution, which deals with the Reserve Bank's independence, to shift the bank's primary focus from the need to protect the currency. Absa has said it was not obliged to return the money, while the Reserve Bank has obtained legal opinion indicating that the remedial action falls outside of the powers of the chapter nine institution. It has said it had been advised to bring urgent review action to have Mkhwebane's findings set aside, and added that it would address factual inaccuracies in her report on the matter. African National Congress secretary general Gwede Mantashe expressed concern about the recommendation for a constitutional amendment, and said the Reserve Bank was doing its job. Breytenbach said the DA was exploring all means at its disposal to address the problems it had with Mkhwebane's findings. She pointed out the Public Protector reported to the portfolio committee on justice but that only the National Assembly had the power to amend the Constitution. \"The remedial actions announced yesterday are very disturbing and they mean that the new Public Protector has either failed to understand her role and powers as Public Protector, or she simply is prepared to break the law to drive political agendas.\" Parliament on Tuesday said it had received Mkhwebane's report and would consider it. \"The report, amongst others, directs the Chairperson of the National Assembly's Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services to initiate a process that will result in the amendment of section 224 of the Constitution, in pursuit of improving socio-economic conditions of the citizens of the Republic,\" the Speaker's office said. \"Parliament will consider the report through its usual internal processes and determine an appropriate course of action.\" - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Judges Elroy Marshall and Eddie Marshall both scored it 97-93 and the third judge Fred van der Ross had it 99-91. The referee was Darryl Ribbink from Durban.

England lost its top three batsmen in its second innings inside 10 overs as Alex Hales, Alastair Cook and Nick Compton all departed without reaching double figures. Joe Root and James Taylor, both on 19 not out, held South Africa at bay until stumps on the fourth day, which only came after 6.30 p.m. due to a mid-afternoon rain delay. England was still 330 runs short. Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada had 2-15 to go with his seven wickets in the first innings to lead South Africa's push for a consolation win. England already clinched the series in the third test in Johannesburg, taking a 2-0 lead with this last match to play. Cook was out for 5 in England's second innings at SuperSport Park, hitting a straight drive back toward quick bowler Morne Morkel, who reached down with his right hand to take the catch and then flung it high in the air in celebration. That meant Cook is still 36 runs short of becoming the first Englishman to 10,000 test runs. With this series over for him with the bat, he'll have to wait until the first test of the English summer in May at least to get to the milestone. Cook's dismissal followed opening partner Hales, who continued to struggle on this tour when a ball from Rabada kept low and trapped him lbw for 1. Compton was out for 6 caught behind off Rabada, and used up a decision review trying to overturn his dismissal. It didn't work and England was in real peril at 18-3. Root hit three fours and took England to the close. He's had an outstanding series, but it will take a major effort from him and the middle and lower order to save the test. South Africa set England the big target off the back of 96 from Hashim Amla and 78 not out from Temba Bavuma. They had a 117-run partnership and Amla nearly reached a second century of the game. Amla and Bavuma took South Africa out of trouble after an early surge from England on the fourth day that had the home team 106-4. That period of England success was mainly down to seamer James Anderson, who finished with 3-47, but also took his 432nd and 433rd test wickets to go past New Zealand's Richard Hadlee and into seventh on the all-time list. The two wickets came quickly for Anderson: He had opener Stephen Cook caught behind and removed South African captain AB de Villiers for a duck two balls later, De Villiers' third duck in a row. It was England's high point of the day. Amla, Bavuma and Rabada then drove South Africa into a mighty position.","label":0}

The lawyers said they wanted to attend the auction of 76.79 percent of Yuganskneftegaz, the main Yukos subsidiary that produces  60 percent of its oil. \"We want to see the people who we will see in court in other places in the world in the near future,\" said Saunders. However, the Interfax news agency later reported that the Menatep legal team had been barred from the sale. Apart from Gazprom's oil unit Gazpromneft, three other companies  have been registered for the auction. Saunders said he did not know the identity of the other bidders,  but suggested that they could be a \"front\" for Gazprom. \"You'll have to peel the onion to find the true player,\" he said. The lawyer did not exclude suing Germany's Deutsche Bank, which is an advisor for Gazprom and could according to him have helped the gas giant pay the 1.77-billion-dollar deposit to take part in the auction.

In his weekly radio and television show on Sunday, Chavez condemned the US oil giant \"bandits\" and \"white-collar criminals\", and said the clash with the company was \"the tip of an iceberg that is economic war\". Venezuela, one of the world's top 10 oil producers, is the fourth largest US supplier of foreign oil, with daily exports of some 1.3 million barrels. Venezuela also depends heavily on its oil exports: it gets 90 percent of its export revenue from oil, and uses oil profits to fund half of the government budget. The United States is the market for half  of its oil output. Chavez has made threats to cut off the US supply before, but this threat comes after ExxonMobil, one of the world's four largest oil companies, won international court orders freezing up to 12 billion dollars in assets of Venezuela's state oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). The US oil giant filed the case after Chavez nationalised foreign oil operations in the Orinoco basin in 2007, including two ExxonMobil operations. The two sides failed to agree on compensation terms. ExxonMobil said it had won court orders in London, the Netherlands and Netherlands Antilles freezing PDVSA assets in those jurisdictions. A New York court has also frozen 300 million dollars worth of the state oil firm's assets. Venezuela's Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez denied on Friday that any  such freeze had taken place. \"Never again will they rob us, these ExxonMobil bandits, they are imperialist thieves, white-collar criminals, corruptors of governments,  they supported the invasion of Iraq ... and they continue to support the genocide in Iraq,\" Chavez said on Sunday. \"Well, I tell the US empire because it is the master -- keep it up, and you will see that we will not send a drop of oil to the US empire. \"If you really manage to freeze (the assets), if you do us damage, we are doing to cause damage too. We are no longer going to send oil to  the United States.\" If this \"economic war\" continued against Venezuela, \"the price of oil will reach 200 dollars\" a barrel, Chavez said. \"More than one country is ready to join us in this economic war. We are not going to be frightened, we are not going to be dissuaded,\" he said. Chavez passed a law in 2007 forcing multinationals to give at least 60 percent of the capital in their Venezuelan operations to PDVSA. He has said Caracas would pay compensation based on the book-price for the assets left behind, and not on the current prices on the oil market.  ExxonMobile and another US-based company, ConocoPhillips, rejected the demand and resorted to international arbitration. In early September ExxonMobil filed a request for arbitration with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID),  an autonomous body within the World Bank which works to resolve disputes between government and foreign private investors. Venezuela is the only Latin-American member of OPEC, the main oil producers' cartel, and four companies accepted Chavez's terms of staying in the country -- France's Total, Norway's Statoil, British Petroleum and US company Chevron.

Interested and qualified individuals have until 23 February 2018 to submit their applications,\" Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said, confirming the adverts which appeared in Sunday newspapers.

Government instructed the newly-elected Eskom board to find suitable candidates to fill the group CEO and group CFO positions permanently within the next three months. Some of the requirements for the CEO position include at least 20 years' experience and understanding and experience in funding and the managing of large capital projects, and an annual turnover in excess of R30 billion.

Turkey, an EU membership candidate, has stepped up cooperation with the European Union to clamp down on migration flows towards the bloc, with Brussels offering aid and benefits - such as the prospect of visa-free EU access for Turkish citizens - in return. At the same time, Erdogan has been accused of a clampdown on media and the opposition. Hahn's made his comments to EU lawmakers debating a Turkish parliamentary decision last month to lift the immunity of 138 legislators, including nearly all pro-Kurdish lawmakers. Hahn spoke of the \"unacceptability\" of the move, which \"contradicts all democratic and rule-of-law conventions.\" \"Turkey, although there are always these statements about becoming a member of the EU, is moving in a completely different direction,\" he said. \"I wish that, starting with president Erdogan, ... there was once a clear statement on whether they are serious about us or not.\" \"There is no Turkish variety of democracy,\" Hahn added. However, he said the EU could not ignore Turkey, one of the most populated countries in the bloc's neighbourhood. EU lawmakers slammed the Turkish immunity decision. \"We are stunned that, in the 21st century, it is possible to create a climate of fear and intimidation in such a way,\" said far-left EU lawmaker Gabi Zimmer. \"It is against all democratic principles to silence opponents simply for their political views,\" added Socialist lawmaker Kati Piri. # Notebook * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Helen Maguire - Editing by: Rachel More, +49 30 2852 31472, dpa hm rmo","label":0}

Spaniard Nadal, seeded the seventh at the 3,288,530 euros indoors tournament, lost to the Swiss the last time the two men met in Paris in the French Open final in June. World No. 1 Djokovic earlier extended his winning streak to 20 and awaited Wawrinka in Saturday's semifinals after beating Czech fifth seed Berdych 7-6 (3), 7-6 (8). The 28-year-old Serb produced a big first serve and a forehand winner off the blocked return to pull the first set into tie-break, which was dominated by Djokovic, winning four of the first five points to take control. Both men held firm to bring up a second straight tie-break, which Djokovic edged 10-8 despite Berdych having another set point. \"I definitely didn't want to go into the third set. Credit to Berdych for playing on a high level, pushing me in the back of the court with hi depth on the shots,\" commented Djokovic. \"The match could have gone a different way,\" he added. Andy Murray and David Ferrer also made it through to the semifinals in the bottom half of the draw, as the second seeded Scot took 158 minutes to beat 10th seed Richard Gasquet of France and the 2012 champion Ferrer defeated 13th-seeded American John Isner also in full sets. Murray made a marathon effort to see off the last remaining Frenchman 7-6 (7), 3-6, 6-3 to make the last four of the indoors tournament for the first time. The 28-year-old had previously fallen in the quarterfinals of the ATP's regular season finale for five times. The win meant that he joined Roger Federer, Nadal and Djokovic as the only players to reach the semifinals or better at all nine of the Masters 1000 Series during their career.

He pushed his approach to the 18th a little right, and from a difficult lie, with very little green to work with, and the green sloping away from him, his chip rattled the flagstick and dropped in the hole, giving him that single-shot edge over Anthony Michael. \"I have been struggling the last couple of events so it's a confidence boost, absolutely,\" he said. \"I felt like I hit it quite nicely, but I was quite jammy on the last when I chipped in from a position that was not very good.\" He had a steady start, making two pars on his opening two holes, before his first birdie of the day came on the third. But he followed that with a bogey on four. It was to be the last blemish on his round, as two more birdies came on the front nine, and five on the back which saw him race home in 30. \"Maybe that 30 was significant,\" he laughed afterwards, a reference to his 30th birthday which he celebrated on Tuesday. Harding was one of those players who has had to make the transition from the long putter to the shorter, unanchored putter, and the change appeared to have hampered the rest of his game too. \"Swing-wise it's always been there or thereabouts,\" he said. \"I've been a bit wonky in terms of posture so it's just about getting a little bit more comfortable standing over the ball and giving myself an opportunity to make better swings and attack some flags. The short putter is moving in the right direction. I wouldn't say it's quite there yet but it's definitely getting better week by week so we'll see what happens.\" Michael missed a two-footer for birdie on the 18th in a round that was otherwise characterised by really good putting. \"The ball bobbled a little as I putted it,\" said Michael, \"but for the rest, the greens were great. \"And I hit a lot of irons off the tees. I'm hitting my irons really well, so I am confident enough to hit a five or six iron into these greens. In the end, I only missed two greens all day,\" he added. In third place, qualifier Theunis Spangenberg was off early and he carded a five-under-par 65 to finish in third after the opening round, one ahead of Jaco van Zyl, who returned to tournament play after taking a three-week break after the Joburg Open. Defending champion George Coetzee made a solid start with his two-under-par 68 for a share of sixth, a position he shared with 10 other players, including Shaun Norris who won last week's Myanmar Open on the Asian Tour. For Harding, it was a welcome return to the form which has brought him four Sunshine Tour titles. \"I haven't really been up here for a while in one of these events, so it's a good feeling,\" he said. \"It's certainly nice to be here. I'm just going to see if I can maybe keep it going. I feel as though I'm hitting it nicely enough.\" - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

His death was attributed to natural causes. U.S. diplomats who dealt with Thanat described him admiringly as shrewd and above all, dedicated to seeking advantage for his country. Shifting international politics saw Thanat move from being an advocate of close links to Washington to a promoter of regional balance by establishing relations with China, which had been a Cold War bogeyman. \"He defended Thailand's interests with grit and grace,\" U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Glyn Davies said in a statement after Thanat's death Thursday. Thanat is credited with being a major force behind the 1967 founding of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional grouping which this year is seeking to evolve into a full-fledged ASEAN Economic Community. After working in the Foreign Ministry under three military dictatorships, Thanat entered politics, serving as leader of the Democrat Party, the country's oldest, in 1979-82 and as a deputy prime minister in 1980-82 before withdrawing from public life. Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai described Thanat on Friday as \"visionary and ... very determined in protect the interests of our country.\" Born on May 9, 1914, Thanat studied law at the University of Paris before joining the Thai Foreign Ministry in 1940 and serving in his country's embassy in Japan, which after occupying Thailand in World War II became its nominal ally. Returning to Thailand before the war ended, he joined the anti-Japanese underground. He resumed his diplomatic career with a posting in Washington in 1946-47, returning there as ambassador in 1957-58. He was named foreign minister in 1959, a job he held until 1971, when he was dismissed in a move thought to be linked to his advocacy of rapprochement with China. Thanat's name is most closely associated with the Rusk-Thanat Communique of 1962 \u2014 issued with then-U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk \u2014 which pledged that the United States would come to Thailand's aid in case it faced aggression. Communist advances in neighboring Laos were the impetus for the agreement, whose importance for both countries grew as communist forces stepped up pressure in South Vietnam as well. The agreement drew Thailand closely into the American orbit, indirectly leading to massive amounts of development aid and the stationing of tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel at air bases around the country used for missions against Vietnam. But when Thanat realized by the end of the 1960s that Washington was unlikely to stick it out in Vietnam, he began urging a realignment of Thailand's foreign relations to win China's favor. Diplomatic relations were established with China in 1975, after Thailand's military rulers had been ousted and U.S.-backed governments in neighboring Indochina were defeated by communist forces. By 1976, the U.S. military was gone. \"Thanat Khoman was a convinced nationalist and worked well with the United States, as long as he felt the relationship was mutually beneficial,\" veteran U.S. diplomat John Gunther Dean recalled in a 2000 oral history interview for the State Department. \"As time went on, Thanat's close relationship with the United States became progressively more strained and he became vocally critical of the U.S. on many subjects.\" \"Thanat favored Asians working together in their own national interest and not relying on one single foreign power for leadership,\" said Dean, the U.S. envoy to Thailand in 1981-85. Thanat, whose survivors include daughter-in-law Sirilaksana Khoman, a leading anti-corruption activist, is to be cremated after traditional Buddhist funeral rites.","label":0}

I wish to briefly review how South Africa joined BRICS and outline the pertinent issues that led to our membership and which are still relevant as we will host the last Summit of the first cycle of BRICS Summits.  The incoming Administration of President Zuma in 2009 reviewed the global trends for economic growth and development and decided to pursue a closer relationship with the BRICS countries as the new growth poles for the global economy. This decision is justified when one considers the profile of BRICS today, i.e. constituting 25% of global GDP (in PPP terms); 30% of global land area; and 43% of global population. The contribution of BRICS to global economic growth has reached over 50% over the past decade, making it the principal driver of global economic development. Depending on whether you measure BRICS economies in dollar terms or in PPP terms, over the next decades,  the BRICS share of world GDP will increase and by 2020, it will account for about 37%-38% and by 2030 this could increase to as much as 45%, that is, almost half of global GDP.  The first BRICS Summit took place in 2009 in the Russian Federation and focused on issues such as reform of the global financial architecture. Minister  Nkoana-Mashabane also wrote at that time to her BRICS counterparts, to indicate  South Africa's desire to collaborate closer with these countries to pursue the restructuring of the global political and economic architecture into one that is more equitable, balanced and which rests on the important pillar of multilateralism. It was emphasised that Africa, as an important member of the global South and the global community had to take its rightful place in a new equitable world order. South Africa had already pursued this vision in the context of the UN as well as other structures such as the G8.  On 23 December 2010, Minister Nkoana-Mashabane was informed by her Chinese counterpart that the President of the People's Republic of China as the Chairperson of BRICS, following consultation with the other BRICS Member States, wishes to invite South Africa to join BRICS and therefore invited President Zuma to attend the Third BRICS Summit which was hosted in Sanya in 2011  One might recall at our attendance of that Summit, the events that marked  the global landscape entailed the global financial crisis as well as the situation in Libya. BRICS have served together on the UN Security Council in 2011 and collaborate closely on issues related  to international peace and security such as Syria currently.  In respect of the global financial crisis, the support of BRICS countries through its trade and investment cooperation with notably Low Income Countries,  of which most are in Africa, assisted these countries to weather the impact of the crisis. BRICS countries, including South Africa, have already collectively contributed to weathering the effects of the international financial crisis and  worked for the common interests of the international community in the wake of this global crisis, such as committing US$75 bn to the IMF.  In the specific case of South Africa, our economic cooperation with BRICS countries has increasingly strengthened. Our trade figures have grown significantly and we have reduced our negative trade balance with these countries from R 57bn in 2008 to R 23 bn in 2011. We expect a further significant reduction once the final figures for 2012 are released. South African exports to China grew 46%, while exports to India grew by 20%, to Brazil by 14%, and to Russia by 7%.  Standard Bank has projected that BRICS-Africa trade will increase threefold from USD150 bn in 2010 to USD530 bn in 2015 and as a result, the BRICS share of  Africa's total trade will increase from one-fifth (2010) to one third over the next five years.  Foreign Direct Investment from BRICS to African countries is projected to increase almost threefold from USD60 bn in 2009 to more than USD150 bn by 2015.  Therefore the theme that was approved by Cabinet for the Summit, i.e. BRICS and Africa: Partnership for Development, Integration and Industrialisation acknowledges the various engagement activities of BRICS countries vis-\u00e0-vis the African continent providing economic cooperation as well as other opportunities for skills development, job creation and sustainable development best practices.  The estimated financing requirement to close Africa's infrastructure deficit, according to the African Development Bank, is around USD 93 bn annually until 2020. The Bank stated that in as much as this financing requirement is a challenge, African governments have a wide range of policy options that could open new sources of finance.  In this regard, I am pleased to inform that our BRICS leaders will receive the report from their Finance Ministers on the feasibility and viability of setting up a new BRICS-led Development Bank for mobilising resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging  economies and developing countries, to supplement the existing efforts of multilateral and regional financial institutions for global growth and development.  This Bank will inter alia utilise the surplus reserves of BRICS countries to support development initiatives among emerging markets and developing countries to support a new model of South-South cooperation and financing.  Other Summit outcomes will entail a first dialogue between BRICS Leaders and  African Heads of State\/Government from the eight Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and the NEPAD Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative (PICIs)  as well as the incoming Chairperson of the African Union (AU) and the Chairperson of the AU Commission, Dr Dlamini Zuma to discuss the issue of infrastructure funding for which the African Union has tasked our President to play a leading role.  We will also strengthen the structures that facilitate the intra-BRICS collaboration between our Captains of Industry and Academics.  Thank you  Ends \/avb","label":0}

On Thursday, the Democratic Alliance accused the municipality of inflating the valuations rates. \"The sting, a painful one indeed, is that the valuations department now has not just inflated, but hyper-inflated property values... from 2008 to levels which bear not the least relation to current market values,\" said DA spokesman John Mendelsohn. He said some properties had lost value, and people should not pay more than they are supposed to. Tugwana said the objections to the valuations were often two-way. Some property owners objected to being under-valued and others object to over-valuation. He said residents were more than welcome to bring their queries, backed by evidence, and the city had made an option for some to come in even on Saturdays.  \"We undertake to investigate and consider each case individually and invite clients to visit our valuation department, on the 4th floor of the Metropolitan  Centre in Braamfontein.\" Sapa \/mvm\/hdw\/dd","label":0}

The 12 stamps illustrate a wide range of taxonomic groups, from marine molluscs, fishes, reptiles to an amphibian, a mammal, a small flowering plant and a large tree. They are found in different parts of the world, and occur in forests, oceans, mountains, steppes and deserts. Some species are iconic and readily recognisable, such as sharks, nautilus and baobab trees, while others look less familiar. The species chosen for this stamp collection exemplify the global character of the work of CITES and the biodiversity it protects through regulating international trade in the species. Commenting on this special edition of the UN Endangered Species Stamps, CITES Secretary-General, John Scanlon, said: \"This year is the first time that the UN Endangered Species Stamps feature species that have been newly added to the CITES Appendices. \"Among the species depicted on these beautiful stamps, the devil rays and thresher sharks are wonderful reminders of the truly historic decisions made at CITES CoP17 to provide international legal protection to so many amazing species of wild animals and plants.

It is crucial for us to extend the course of the campaign by incorporating it into our daily lives in order to see visible change.   The escalation of child on child violence proves that there is an improper message sent out to our children and it is also an obvious factor that proves the 16 days campaign has no lasting impact. The moral fibre of our society has completely depleted, adults and even children have become totally desensitised.   NADECO believes that it is crucial to rope in a moral regeneration element into the 16 days campaign. We have to curb the  irresponsible and insubordinate actions of a society that has lost conscience and replace them with moral values that will preserve and sustain the future of our country.   It is imperative for us to work towards a strategy that will give us a comprehensive understanding of the problem dealt with. Understanding the root of this crisis we are facing will enable us to device workable solutions for women and children that are at risk or those that have fallen victim to violent crimes. It will also aid us to set up an effective strategy for perpetrators or potential perpetrators.  NADECO calls on all government departments, political parties, civil society and individuals that are directly and indirectly affected to join us as we take a firm stand against this crisis by making a visible effort to extend the 16 days campaign.  Let us all assume a meaningful role in this course by implementing mechanisms that will contribute positively towards the  well-being of women and children that have fallen victim to violent  crimes.

IN a bid to intensify the fight against corruption, maladministration and fraud within municipalities, KZN Legislature will this weekend establish the provincial forum with the province's municipalities in order to strengthen oversight and improve accountability at local government level.  The provincial forum follows the formation last year of Municipal Public Accounts Committees (MPACs), which are a local government equivalent of the national and provincial Standing Committees on Public Accounts (SCOPA).  MPACs, just like SCOPAs, will act as a council watchdog over how the public monies are spent at municipal level and also hold the council executive accountable.  All KZN municipalities will this weekend attend a meeting in Durban which will be addressed by Speaker of KZN Legislature Peggy Nkonyeni, Provincial SCOPA chairperson Sipho Nkosi and representatives of the department of Co-Operative Governance and Traditional Affairs.  The meeting will also be addressed by representatives of Treasury, the South  African Local Government Association (SALGA) and the national Association of Public Accounts Committees (APAC).  Amongst issues to be discussed is the state of MPACs in KwaZulu-Natal especially the challenges that the committees face and what kind of intervention they need in order to be more effective in fighting corruption, fraud and maladministration within municipalities.  \"Now that the MPACs have been established in all municipalities, the objective is to find out how are they functioning, what kind of support do they  have and what kind of training they have had so far and what kind of training they will need in the future. But more importantly we need to find ways on how are they going to organize themselves to learn from each other and exchange information,\" said Nkonyeni.  She added that the KZN Legislature has been working very closely with MPACs by inviting the committees to attend SCOPA hearings at the legislature so that they could see how the provincial committee was holding the executive to account.   Provincial SCOPA has also had a number of its hearings held at various municipalities.  The formation of provincial MPACs forum could go a long way in strengthening  oversight and accountability at local government level thereby ensuring that public funds are properly accounted for.  The Media is invited to attend the workshop and launch of MPACs Forum.

The 22-year-old woman was in the care of the Dutch Embassy after a brief court hearing in Doha, the Qatari capital which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Her case has raised new questions ahead of the tournament, which likely will draw tens of thousands of Western tourists unfamiliar with the Islamic-based legal codes that govern the small peninsular nation. It wasn't immediately clear what sentence was given to the man she accused of rape. Qatari officials repeatedly have declined to comment after her detention became public knowledge over the weekend. The woman, on a vacation with a friend, went out for drinks at a hotel bar in the Qatari capital in mid-March, lawyer Brian Lokollo previously told The Associated Press. While at the bar, she believes someone \"messed with her drink\" and her memory became hazy, Lokollo said. She later awoke alone, her clothes torn and the victim of a rape, he said. She was immediately detained after reporting the attack, Lokollo said. She previously appeared three times in court, he said. A social media campaign has been launched to call for her release. The AP does not identify victims of sexual assault. The woman faced an adultery charge for having sex out of wedlock. Her release and sentence were confirmed by Dutch Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Daphne Kerremans. The Dutch Embassy in Doha declined to comment further. Alcohol is available at high-end hotels in Qatar and duty-free shops at its massive international airport. However, residents must have permission from their employers to buy at the country's only government-run liquor store. Sex out of wedlock is illegal. Similar cases have occurred elsewhere in the Gulf Arab states. In 2008, an Australian woman said she was jailed for eight months after reporting that she was gang-raped at a hotel in the United Arab Emirates. In 2013, a Norwegian woman who reported being raped in Dubai received a 16-month sentence for having sex outside of marriage, though she was pardoned and allowed to leave the country. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at His work can be found at","label":0}

The Eagles scored five tries to three in an entertaining game that could have gone either way with three minutes to play. The Elephants came into the match having lost their opening encounter against defending champions Western Province and were desperate for a win. The Eagles were playing their first game of the campaign and were eager to stamp their authority. But it was the Elephants who struck first and as early as the seventh minute when centre Nkululeko Marwana burst through midfield before laying a pass off to scrumhalf Rowan Gouws, who scored. Flyhalf Henrique Olivier missed the conversion but kicked a 22nd minute penalty to extend the lead to 8-0. It took the visitors just over half-an-hour to appear on the scoreboard and it came after a period of sustained pressure as left wing Marlo Weich crashed over from close out. Fullback Leighton Eksteen slotted the easy conversion to make it a one-point ball game. Eksteen then turned try-scorer minutes later when he stepped past numerous defenders in midfield to run 40m and score under the posts. Flyhalf Divan Nel converted to make it 14-8 at the break. The home team were back in the lead soon after half-time when hooker Allandre Van Rooyen scored from a lineout drive. Olivier added the extra two points before Elephants replacement prop Dewald Barnard intercepted the ball on the 10m line to run through and score in the corner. But it was back to a one-point difference at 20-19 when Eagles hooker Jacuqes Vermaak forced his way over in the corner.

Flyhalf Nel then put the Eagles seven points ahead when he kicked a 40m penalty with only three minutes remaining on the clock. And they closed the game out when Fisher dived over for his second try of the afternoon for Nel to convert.

The 50-year-old Cristina is accused of two counts of tax fraud carrying a maximum prison sentence of eight years for allegedly failing to declare taxes on personal expenses paid by a real estate company she owned with her husband. She will sit in the dock with 17 others including her husband, Olympic handball medalist turned businessman Inaki Urdangarin. He faces more serious charges of using his Duke of Palma title to embezzle about 6 million euros ($6.5 million) in public contracts through the nonprofit Noos Institute he ran with an associate. The princess said nothing to dozens of reporters after arriving at a makeshift courtroom in Palma de Mallorca where the trial is being held. Security was tight around the building after thousands of anti-monarchy protesters in 2014 staged noisy demonstrations while Cristina answered questions about the case posed by a investigative judge. Authorities Monday morning detained one protester with an anti-monarchy flag a short time before Cristina showed up at the court inside a sedan with dark tinted windows. There are so many defendants and lawyers plus reporters covering the case that judicial officials were forced to move the trial from a courthouse to a sprawling building complex on the outskirts of Palma de Mallorca normally used to hold mass training courses for public servants. The case is being heard in the regional capital of Spain's Balearic Islands because many of Urdangarin's business deals were for the islands. The princess and her husband are not expected to utter a word during the first few days of the trial as judges read out the 89 alleged crimes committed by the suspects, and lawyers including Cristina's make arguments aimed at having their clients removed from the case. She denied knowledge of her husband's activities during the 2014 closed door court appearance and a prosecutor recommended she should be fined. But a judge decided Cristina could be charged with tax fraud in 2007 and 2008 because Spanish law allows groups to file charges when state prosecutors don't. Her case was driven forward by the anti-corruption group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands). ___ Clendenning reported from Madrid.","label":1}

A spokesman for the country's main Tutsi party, the Union for National Progress (UPRONA), which also represented at the meeting, agreed with Ngendakumana's account of Zuma's message. \"He said he was not here to negotiate, he said very simply that the constitution should not be touched,\" said the spokesman Gerard Nduwayo. \"he said that amending the constitution would imperil the peace process.\" Ndayizeye wants to amend the constitution to allow for direct universal suffrage but is opposed by his own party, FRODEBU, and the main former Hutu rebel group, the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD).

He says the obvious response was to break up fraudulent operators and says he introduced legislation to accomplish that. Sanders says Clinton was busy giving high-paid speeches to Goldman Sachs. Clinton says Sanders can't come up with an example because there isn't one. She says it's important to get the facts straight even if it's inconvenient. ___ 9:18 p.m. Hillary Clinton is trying to show Bernie Sanders isn't the only candidate ready to break up banks. Clinton says she would order regulators to break up banks if they don't pass their stress tests or submit adequate \"living wills\" as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill. Clinton says she would name regulators who \"are tough enough and ready enough to break up\" any bank that fails meet the law's requirements. Clinton says she wants to expand those standards to apply to hedge funds and insurance companies. Sanders responds that he doesn't need Dodd-Frank's guidelines to tell him the banks are too big. He says, \"They are just too big \u2014 too much concentration of wealth and power.\" ___ 9:15 p.m. Hillary Clinton is using President Barack Obama as a shield against Bernie Sanders' attacks on her campaign contributions. Clinton was booed at Thursday night's debate when she said Sanders' attack was an attack on Obama. She says people may not like the answer, but insists Sanders is mounting a \"phony attack.\" Clinton says Obama had a super PAC when he ran for president, and took tens of millions of dollars from contributors. She says despite all that, Obama wasn't influenced by those factors when he signed the Dodd-Frank financial reforms into law. Clinton says Sanders' attack is designed to raise questions despite there being no evidence to support his insinuations. ___ 9:12 p.m. Hillary Clinton is swinging hard at Bernie Sanders in the opening round of the latest Democratic debate. Clinton is pointing to a recent interview Sanders did with the editorial board of the New York Daily News. She is noting the \"kind of problems\" Sanders had answering questions about breaking up big banks and saying he could not answer a number of questions on foreign policy. Clinton says, \"I think you need the judgment on day one to be both president and commander in chief.\" Sanders is pushing back, questioning Clinton's judgment in supporting the war in Iraq and accepting support from super PACs. He asks, \"Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying she is going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?\" ___ 9:10 p.m. Donald Trump is telling attendees at the New York State Republican Party's annual gala how he helped save the hotel where the gala is being held. All three Republican presidential candidates are expected to speak at the black-tie gala at a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Thursday night, as the Democratic candidates hold a debate across the East River in Brooklyn. For the first time in a generation, the New York primary is playing a key role in deciding the nominees of both political parties. Trump has a decisive lead in the polls ahead of the state's April 19 primary. He explained how he expanded his father's business from the outer boroughs into the heart of Manhattan. He barely mentioned his campaign or political platform at the start of his speech, joking that it's boring to discuss politics all the time. ___ 9:08 p.m. Hillary Clinton is pulling out her New York credentials fast. In her opening statement at Thursday night's Democratic debate in her home state, Clinton beamed as she noted how happy she was to be in New York. She quickly noted her years as senator representing the state, saying \"we faced difficult challenges together.\" Clinton noted the Sept. 11 attacks, her support for first responders and her work trying to bring in jobs from \"Buffalo to Albany.\" She says \"we worked hard to keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.\" ___ 9:05 p.m. Bernie Sanders says his campaign is doing as well at it is because he's doing something radical: telling Americans the truth. Sanders is touting his recent wins in caucuses and primaries in his opening statement of Thursday night's Democratic debate. He's pointing out the progress he's made in preference polls since his campaign started. Sanders says the U.S. can't move forward until the Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United campaign finance case is overturned. He says the U.S. needs \"real campaign reform\" to prevent super PACs from buying elections. Sanders says he's determined to end a \"rigged economy\" where the rich get richer and everyone else gets poorer. He says he wants to create an economy that works for everyone and not just the top 1 percent of Americans. ___ 9 p.m. The final Democratic debate before next week's New York presidential primary is under way in Brooklyn, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders getting the first opening statement. ___ 8:00 p.m. Former New York Gov. George Pataki is endorsing John Kasich. Pataki ended his own brief Republican presidential campaign late last year. He announced his support for the Ohio governor on Thursday night. That's just five days before New York's high-stakes presidential primary. Pataki says Kasich \"has a track record of bringing people together.\" He warns that Republican front-runner Donald Trump would \"drive the Republican Party off the cliff.\" ___ 4:23 p.m. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is releasing a new 30-second ad that urges voters in New York to \"send a message\" to Wall Street banks and billionaires. The ad says \"nothing will change until we elect candidates who reject Wall Street money.\" It makes no mention of rival Hillary Clinton, but amplifies Sanders' message of opposing the outside groups known as super PACs and campaign donations from the financial industry. Sanders often questions Clinton's ties to super PACs and has called for the former secretary of state to release the transcripts of her paid speeches to employees of Wall Street banks. The ad targets a \"corrupt political system that keeps in place a rigged economy where Wall Street buys off elections.\" ___ 3:50 p.m. The Vatican says Pope Francis has no plans to meet with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders when the Democratic presidential candidate speaks at a Vatican conference on Friday. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi told reporters Thursday that the pope has no plans to either address the conference or meet with Sanders. Lombardi said: \"I'm not expecting anything.\" Sanders has said he would be honored to meet with the pope but no meeting has been arranged. Sanders has long admired Pope Francis, who preaches a message of social and economic justice similar to the senator's agenda on the campaign trail. Dozens of speakers will commemorate the 25th anniversary of a high-level teaching document by Pope John Paul II on the economy and social justice at the end of the Cold War. ___ 2:40 p.m. Donald Trump's campaign manager says he is \"gratified\" by a Florida prosecutor's decision to drop a battery charge against him in an incident with a female reporter. Corey Lewandowski, in a statement released by the campaign on Thursday, said he \"appreciates the thoughtful confederation and professionalism\" displayed by the state attorney in Palm Beach. Lewandowski also said he appreciated Trump's \"loyalty\" and the support of his colleagues. The campaign's statement then declares \"the matter is now concluded.\" Police had last month charged Corey Lewandowski after determining that a video recording showed him grabbing reporter Michelle Fields by the arm. She worked for the conservative Breitbart News website at the time and was trying to ask Trump a question after a March 8 appearance. The decision comes at a time when Lewandowski's influence in the campaign may be waning. While Lewandowski maintains the title campaign manager and travels with the candidate, Trump in recent weeks has hired a pair of veteran Washington operatives to take prominent roles in the campaign. ___ 2:00 p.m. A court document filed Thursday says that Donald Trump's campaign manager will not be prosecuted on a misdemeanor battery charge after prosecutors determined there wasn't enough evidence to convict him of forcibly grabbing a female reporter. Police had last month charged Corey Lewandowski after determining that a video recording showed the New York City resident grabbed reporter Michelle Fields by the arm. She worked for the conservative Breitbart News website at the time and was trying to ask Trump a question after a March 8 appearance. Fields later tweeted a photograph of her bruised forearm and said she had been yanked backward. \"Although there was probable cause to make an arrest, the evidence cannot prove all legally required elements of the crime alleged and is insufficient to support a criminal prosecution,\" according to a court document filed by state attorney Dave Aronberg. ___ 1:20 p.m. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is making an impassioned case to a New York gathering of black leaders that he's the Democrat who can best address the nation's problems and defeat Republican Donald Trump. Sanders is speaking Thursday to the National Action Network conference led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. The meeting comes hours before a Democratic presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. Sanders is outlining a litany of policy proposals on jobs, education and criminal justice. He says if people think the issues will be addressed by \"establishment politics and establishment economics, you've got a very good candidate to vote for but it's not Bernie Sanders.\" He says he respects Clinton and calls her \"an extremely intelligent woman with a wonderful resume and a whole lot of experience.\" He adds, \"In a campaign things get heated up.\" ___ 12:35 p.m. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz says he supports the ability of North Carolina lawmakers to pass a law restricting bathroom access for gay and transgender people. Cruz said Thursday during taping of a MSNBC town hall in Buffalo, New York, that states can pass such laws because \"men should not be going to the bathroom with little girls.\" Cruz says, \"That is a perfectly reasonable determination for the people to make.\" But Cruz would not comment on an executive order signed by North Carolina's governor \"to protect privacy and equality\" for many state workers \"to cover sexual orientation and gender identity.\" Cruz says he isn't familiar with the details of what was signed. North Carolina has faced a national backlash from gay rights groups, entertainers and business leaders who say the law unfairly targets gay and lesbian people. ___ 12:30 p.m. The vast majority of Americans say they prefer lower prices instead of paying a premium for items labeled \"Made in the U.S.A.,\" even if it means those cheaper items are made abroad, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll released Thursday. While presidential candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are vowing to bring back millions of American jobs lost to China and other foreign competitors, public sentiment reflects core challenges confronting the U.S. economy. Incomes have barely improved, forcing many households to look for the most convenient bargains instead of goods made in America. Employers now seek workers with college degrees, leaving those with only a high school degree who once would have held assembly lines jobs in the lurch. Nearly three in four say they would like to buy goods manufactured inside the United States, but those items are often too costly or difficult to find, according to the survey. A mere 9 percent say they only buy American. ___ 12:00 p.m. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is standing by an accusation he made on the Senate floor that Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lied to him. Cruz did not apologize for his remarks made last summer when they were played during taping of an MSNBC town hall on Thursday in Buffalo, New York. Cruz said instead that \"every word I said there is true and accurate. No one has disputed a word I said.\" Despite challenging the trustworthiness of the Republican majority leader, Cruz said if elected president he could work effectively with GOP leadership. Cruz has railed against what he calls the \"Washington cartel\" and cast himself as a Washington outsider, despite pursuing support from fellow lawmakers. Cruz says if elected president \"I will work very, very closely with leaders in Congress.\" ___ 11:50 a.m. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is making a pitch to New York voters saying a state law banning fracking is hurting the economy and diverting jobs to neighboring states. Cruz said Thursday during a taping of a MSNBC town hall meeting in Buffalo, New York, that state is wrong to have a law banning hydraulic fracturing, an oil-and-gas extraction method known as fracking. He said legalizing it could put thousands of people to work in upstate New York where there are large shale reserves that could be tapped. Cruz blamed the anti-fracking law on \"knuckleheaded Democratic politicians.\" His comments came after being asked yet again to defend his criticism of \"New York values.\" Cruz said the people of upstate New York \"have been suffering under the misguided policies of liberal Democratic politicians for a long, long time.\" ___ 10:30 a.m. Speaker Paul Ryan says the whole world is watching American politics and that he can understand how Middle East allies would be rattled by Republican Donald Trump's comments. In an interview with reporters Thursday, the Wisconsin Republican criticized the president's foreign policy and said allies wanted to know if the U.S. is \"still in the game.\" Ryan recently led a congressional delegation to five countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan and Egypt. He said allies were rattled a bit by administration policy. Asked if Trump's comments had rattled them as well, Ryan said, \"Sure. I get that, too. Everybody pays attention to our politics.\" Ryan said it's unrealistic to think that if the U.S. pulls back, \"our oceans are going to save us.\" ___ 10:10 a.m. A top Donald Trump adviser says the businessman is on a \"glide path\" to reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination. Ed Brookover spoke to reporters Thursday following a meeting with House members who have endorsed Trump. He says the meeting was the first in a series of gatherings he'll be holding with lawmakers. While Brookover did not spell out Trump's path to the nomination in detail, Rep. Chris Collins, R-NY, says meeting participants outlined a scenario in which Trump receives 1,265 delegates. Collins says that scenario is based on Trump winning nearly all of the delegates in Tuesday's New York primary and the race continuing through California on June 7. ___ 9:05 a.m. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is disavowing remarks made by a campaign surrogate who said voters shouldn't \"continue to elect corporate Democratic whores\" during a large New York City rally. Sanders said on Twitter Thursday that the comment by Dr. Paul Song \"was inappropriate and insensitive.\" He writes that \"there's no room for language like that in our political discourse.\" Song is a California health care activist who was among several speakers who spoke before Sanders addressed a Wednesday night rally in Washington Square Park. Song said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had said Sanders' Medicare for all plan wouldn't happen. He said it wouldn't happen if voters \"continue to elect corporate Democratic whores\" beholden to special interests.","label":1}

Liebenberg lost a split decision despite appearing to dominate large chunks of the fight, a verdict that left Berman furious. \"This is the second time Liebenberg has found himself on the wrong end of the stick and I am looking to you to right a disgraceful wrong,\" he wrote in his letter to WBA president Gilberto Mendoza. Berman said his anger was directed at the officials rather than the WBA itself and he was confident the organisation would be fair and mandate a rematch. In a separate but related development, Berman has also petitioned the WBC to give Liebenberg a fair shake. Both fighters turned in commendable performances, but Liebenberg appeared superior in all departments. \"Things didn't go our way, but we'll be back,\" said Liebenberg. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Residents refusing to move out of their homes threw gas bombs at  the security forces, igniting riots Wednesday in Shengzhou city, Zhejiang province, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre for Human  Rights and Democracy said. Up to 20,000 protesters and onlookers were at the scene of the riots that left at least five police cars smashed up, it said. About 20 people were injured in the clashes involving \"hundreds\"  of police and security personnel, while six rioters were arrested as fire engines were called in to disperse the crowd, it said. Police in Shengzhou refused to comment on the unrest when contacted by AFP, but a local government official denied that clashes had broke out. \"The police did not call in fire engines to disperse the crowd and tear gas was not used,\" the official at the Shengzhou city office told AFP. \"The crowd dispersed on their own.\" A news report on the Southern Daily website said a 90-year old woman who refused to leave a four-storey building had hurled gas bombs from the top of the building as security personnel and wrecking teams came to destroy it. Photos on the Internet showed the building decked out with Chinese flags and protest banners that called for \"just compensation\" and cited China's property law which was passed by the national legislature in March this year. Up to 20 people were living in tents on the roof of the building, as they protested the imminent destruction of the structure to make way for a new road. The demolition did not go ahead as scheduled due to the unrest. According to online reports, a petition to save the building had  been featured in the leading People's Daily in March as the state press trumpeted the new property law which details protections for private property. Forced demolitions of homes has become one of communist China's hottest social issues as residents accuse government officials of colluding with property developers to requisition land for lucrative real estate projects.

Malema was expected to have a consultative meeting with the workers about their salaries and working conditions at Implats. A large crowd of men holding umbrellas gathered at Freedom Park sports grounds to wait for him to arrive. Some sat in groups while others blew whistles and sang liberation songs in front of the podium where Malema was expected to speak. The workers went on strike five weeks ago demanding a minimum pay of R9000 a  month. Last week, Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) general secretary Zwelinzima  Vavi urged them to return to work, but most refused. Three people have died and scores have been injured in violence related to the illegal strike. On Tuesday, the police watched the proceedings from a distance. Implats has been blamed for the strike by National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) general secretary Frans Baleni. He said on Monday that the NUM's central structures had not been informed that Implats was going to implement a salary adjustment for miners. This retention bonus was apparently not given to rock drill operators, which  led to them walking off the job, followed by thousands of other miners. Implats  fired 17,200 workers after they refused to go back to their jobs. Initially, Implats said the dismissed workers could reapply for their positions, but would lose any benefits they previously had.  However, on Friday the NUM and Implats agreed that workers could be reinstated with their previous benefits intact. They would not be paid for the days they did not work. The company said it would take back only 15,000 workers, leaving 2200 jobless. Sapa \/mm\/mp\/fg\/ks\/clh","label":1}

The commander had been brought in to head the unit after two of its members were convicted of assault in 2003 for setting their dogs on three illegal immigrants for \"training\" purposes. Superintendent Krishna Naidoo and his 29-year-old brother-in-law  Keegan Ragavan allegedly approached a suspected drug dealer in Benoni on Tuesday, February 8, telling him he was under surveillance.  \"However, they allegedly also suggested that a payment of R50,000 to them could make the surveillance 'disappear',\" Opperman said.  The man agreed and said he was prepared to pay the first instalment on Friday. He then informed the police of the development. Police arrested Ragavan -- who is not a police officer -- when he allegedly received R7,500 from the man in Benoni. He was released on bail of R2,000 and was due to appear again on  March 12. After his brother in law's arrest, Naidoo handed himself over to  Kempton Park detectives. He appeared in the Benoni Regional Court on Wednesday and the case was postponed to March 1. Opperman said the area commissioner would make a decision on suspension in terms of the Labour Relations Act. Former East Rand police dog handlers Nicolaas Kenneth Loubser and Dino Guiotto, were found guilty on three counts of assault with  intent to cause grievous bodily harm and attempting to defeat the ends of justice following an attack on three illegal immigrants they had arrested. The matter sparked international outrage when it became public after SABC's \"Special Assignment\" was handed a video of the assaults. Sapa","label":0}

Lingelethu West police were conducting routine patrols on Friday when they received information about illegal activities at the Tsepetsepe informal settlement in Khayelitsha.

Visagie, who has been a fugitive since October last year, was apprehended during an intelligence-driven operation. A warrant for his arrest had been issued.

Chinamasa described the members as \"people of integrity and vast  administrative experience.\" Harare had earlier said new electoral legislation, including the  appointment of an \"independent\" poll body, will bring Zimbabwe into  line with principles adopted at a summit of southern African leaders in Mauritius in August.

The metalworkers' union must provide the CEC with reasons why it should not be expelled or suspended after being accused of contravening Cosatu's constitution. On the agenda on Friday was the status of Cosatu second deputy president Zingiswa Losi, who resigned from Ford earlier this year, where she was a Numsa shop steward. This called into question her eligibility to continue to serve as  a Cosatu leader. Following her resignation, she joined the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union. She was suspended by her local Numsa branch in Port Elizabeth, in the Eastern Cape, last year.

On Friday, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled in favor of Argentina that the ship should be freed. The three-masted Libertad has been held in the Ghanaian port of Tema since October 2 under a Ghanaian court order requested by NML Capital, a Cayman Islands investment firm that says Argentina owes it $370 million. Argentina rescheduled and refinanced much of its debt following an economic crisis and massive default a decade ago, but bonds held by speculative funds such as NML are among its unsettled business. Officials in Ghana declined comment until they have had the opportunity to review the tribunal's ruling. NML called it \"completely inappropriate for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea to attempt to interfere with orderly proceedings of the independent judiciary of Ghana.\" \"Nothing changes the fact that Argentina has the capacity to honor its contractual obligations, but refuses to do so,\" the statement continued. The government of President Cristina Kirchner contends that Ghana \"violated the norms of international law that confer immunity on ships of war.\" The Argentine navy uses the Libertad as a training ship. The captain and a 44-member skeleton crew remain aboard the ship, while 280 other crew members returned to Argentina in late October. Ghana has argued that the tribunal is not competent as the matter is a private trade dispute. Sapa-AFP \/ma","label":0}

During a pre-trial conference both parties meet before the judge or magistrate to prepare for and expedite the matter and, in some cases, discuss a  plea. Last month, the court heard that a mental health panel unanimously found the  British businessman fit to stand trial. The National Prosecuting Authority said it expected the trial, set to begin on October 6, to take two months. According to an indictment previously handed to the court, Dewani is charged  with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice. The State alleges he acted in common purpose and conspired with Cape Town residents Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, and Xolile Mngeni to kill his wife. He  allegedly paid them. Tongo, Qwabe, and Mngeni are already serving jail terms for the murder. Dewani has not yet been asked to plead. He claims he and his wife Anni were kidnapped at gunpoint as they drove through Gugulethu, Cape Town, in a minibus taxi during their honeymoon in November 2010. Shrien Dewani was released unharmed, but Anni was shot dead. Her body was found in the abandoned minibus the next day. Sapa \/nsm\/th\/kn","label":0}

If it does decide to go on strike, it will be the biggest strike in South Africa this year,\" the union said. Solidarity's secretary for the industry, Johan Pieterse, said union members had indicated their final demand of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent would be the only way to avert protest action and a possible strike. Earlier the union said it would accept nothing below eight percent. \"Solidarity has given employers' organisations 24 hours to respond to our... wage increase demand. \"If we do not receive a positive response, we shall give notice to the metal and engineering bargaining council of our members' intention to embark on protest action within 48 hours, and this may  develop into a full-blown strike in the industry,\" Pieterse said in  a statement. Earlier this week the employers' organisation Seifsa -- Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of SA -- offered workers in different categories an increase of five percent and six percent. The offer was rejected unanimously. Seifsa director Brian Angus told Sapa he did not think the employers would agree to Solidarity's demands. \"I cannot see the employers agreeing to that,\" he said. The employers' offer was well above the inflation rate and they believed it was fair. Employers would meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss a number of issues on the wage negotiations, including Solidarity's threats. Sapa","label":2}

{"id":"5db56b93ee1f200017463d4d","url":"SAPAI-17394b0ea8-63475.txt","text":"(CLARIFIES 5TH PAR; MINOR EDITS) A second postponement in two days has prevented an early conclusion to an Independent Democrats (ID) disciplinary hearing, which could determine ousted Western Cape leader Lennit Max's political future. Max appeared on Wednesday at the ID's parliamentary offices to face six charges of misconduct and bringing the party into disrepute. In a sign of things to come, the meeting began 25 minutes later than the scheduled 9am, with Max's lawyer Leon van Rensburg delayed  by consultation with another client. The chairwoman, Sarah Christie, wanted answers on a range of issues which cropped up at Tuesday's first meeting. These include perceived non-cooperation between the two sides; an application for  legal representation for Max; and an application for a postponement  for him to undergo surgery. Van Rensburg, who was not present Tuesday, said he had stayed away because he thought Max had to apply to the chairwoman to be allowed legal representation. According to Van Rensburg there was no indication from court papers -- an earlier agreement between the  papers was made an order of the Cape High Court -- or from the ID that he could appear for Max at the hearing. On the unspecified medical condition and mooted postponement, Van Rensburg said it was not certain Max would undergo an operation, with clarity from doctors available on Monday of next week. \"All I can say is that there are no mala fides involved,\" said Van Rensburg in response to a question from Christie about the timing of the matter, raised for the first time on Tuesday. Van Rensburg said he did not want to appear to be trying to delay proceedings. Turning to the perceived lack of co-operation between the parties, Van Rensburg said Max's team had done all they could to co-operate, but had still not received relevant documents from the ID, such as witness statements. \"We don't want to be ambushed during the hearing,\" he said, adding that they wanted to be able to compare was said in statements with what was said in evidence. Responding for the ID, advocate Joey Moses said the question of legal representation had been \"pertinently\" dealt with, and there could have been no uncertainty on Max's part that the ID had changed its mind, and no longer opposed his being represented. \"We are saying that the high court agreement amply and clearly demonstrated there was no problem with legal representation,\" said Moses. If there was any ambiguity, a simple telephone call could have cleared the matter up. Moses said Van Rensburg's absence on Tuesday despite agreement that the hearing begin then, coupled with the application for legal  representation and a postponement, \"smacked of the abuse of the process\". Christie urged the parties to meet and robustly thrash out a \"pre-hearing hearing\". They should deal with papers, and clarify what was agreed and what was still in dispute, so as to curtail the  need for oral evidence. She said they ought to move swiftly to get to the merits of the matter, which was prejudicial to a number of people. \"It isn't a regular matter about a toothpaste,\" she said. The matter was postponed until a date could be agreed upon, probably sometime after February 14. Sapa","label":0}

The Sasol League was established in 2009 to develop the ladies game with approximately 4 000 footballers competing on a regular basis. One of the clubs is Grassland, who soldier on every day in spite of numerous challenges. In an interview with Safa.net Magwete said: \"The bottom line is that we have little to no resources. We don't even have a training ground due to gang disruptions. \"It can be very challenging but we keep pushing. The girls meet on the day of a game and we simply play. I fund their travel costs and they arrive via bus,\" he said. Despite of the tough times, the girls never fail to display their talent. Players come from small surrounding towns such as Brandfort, Soutpan and Dewetsdorp. With a pool of around 40 young ladies, the numbers are most certainly there and things are starting to take shape. \"We started by recruiting Under-16 girls and playing friendly matches in the Northern Cape and took it from there. The way they are playing now is excellent. They work hard and on our day no other team can beat us,\" said Magwete. The owner also stated that winning the Free State stream isn't even on his radar and he simply wants to compete and allow the girls to gain some much-needed experience. He did, however, have a few thoughts on the women's game itself. \"The ladies game is tough but there is most certainly a light at the end of the tunnel. We need to accept female players the way they are. Each of them has to start somewhere and be given the tools required to progress,\" added Magwete. The coach had a message for the long-serving supporters of the club. \"A huge thank you to all the fans and supporters of the team. Please keep on backing us and attending games. We are trying our best to make you proud,\" concluded Magwete. He lamented the fact that many of his girls get national trial call-ups, but eventually this falls flat due to a lack of identity and passport documents. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Michael Sherman","label":0}

With the total number of nations competing still under discussion, a promotion\/relegation format could be considered. Rugby Europe at a board of directors meeting held in Paris in December agreed to push for the changes. Currently, England, France, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete in the Six Nations. Rugby Europe President Octavian Morariu spoke about the move which could help in spreading the game in Europe. \"The development of rugby in Europe entails each Union having the opportunity to play regularly with the best teams in order to raise standards,\" Morariu said. \"Promotion and relegation system belongs to Rugby Europe ethical code in all our competitions.\" Morariu said talks between Rugby Europe and the organisers of the Six Nations were on the cards. \"It is not about punishing a specific team because of its results in the tournament,\" said Morariu. \"We don't want to compromise what has been achieved until now, but opening a dialogue seems to us crucial for the benefit of all. \"On a sports point of view considering the development and future of our sport; for economic consideration as Europe cannot be limited to six countries; and finally, politically, because we are a continent whose official governing body is Rugby Europe. \"We are open to consider all alternatives, either a direct relegation, the insertion of an annual or every two-year play-off system; the integration of one or two teams or the setup of a real European competition. \"We are aware this process will require time to build a common project and achieve it, but we need to start a real collaboration in the interests of European rugby growth.\" - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Its  subject is \"The ANC and your position\", which suggests that something Shaik had been doing as a member of the ANC or on behalf of that organization had been discussed, and the rest of the letter  spells out the decision reached in consequence of that discussion. Its message, apart from the writer's personal views, is certainly abrupt and even blunt and it does not readily admit of the party's blessing for Shaik to continue his plans on his own. That may have been the effect of what is said, but it is not what the letter says. His energetic pursuit of business opportunities thereafter, as indicated by the evidence, shows that he was not unduly fazed by  the communication. Indeed, defiance of difficulties seems to be part of his character. For it is also clear that his interest in Malaysian contacts did  not end then and it was by no means confined to defence sector possibilities. Apart from the Point area development and the Hilton  Hotel, eco-tourism in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal, toll roads, airports and holiday resorts along the North Coast were also avenues he was keen to explore and exploit as the black economic empowerment partner of any foreign or domestic firm he could interest in doing so. Even after his agreement with Thomson, there are indications, no doubt from Shaik's suggestion, that Thomsons would consider Malaysian participation in their ventures. One of Thomson's early such ventures, of which Nkobi Holdings and, subsequently, Kobifin Limited (Pty) and Kobitech (Pty) Limited  were a part was, while acting in concert with Face Technologies, which was a division of Denel, the securing of a contract driven by  the Department of Transport for the production of the polyester driver's licence cards. This came to be known as the Prodiba project, which is discussed more fully in relation to count 2. But the most important aspects of Thomson's activities in South Africa in this trial were, first, the part it played in the bidding  process for the new Navy corvettes and its eventual accommodation of Nkobi's interests in the benefit of such bid; and, secondly, its  alleged attempt with Shaik thereafter to buy Zuma's protection from  any public investigation of the arms deal and his promotion of Thomson's interests in the future which is the subject of count 3. However, to establish how that all came about and how the State says the influence of Zuma was invoked and applied, it is, unfortunately, necessary to set out a little of the history of the bidding process that came to be known as \"The strategic defence package programme\". This programme consisted of several exploratory  and investigative stages, extending from March 1997 to November and  December 1998, when the successful bids were announced and even beyond to late 1999 and early 2000 when, after prolonged negotiations, the final contracts were signed by Armscor. Starting with the defined requirements of each service arm, information was sought from the governments of several countries whose industrial capacity included the ability to produce the required needs of the white paper. From the answers received, it seems international competition was keen and it may be of interest to note that, of the nine governments so asked, one did not reply but there were nevertheless responses from eleven countries. Three governments not so asked also submitted unsolicited information. In  fact and in all, for the seven products to be acquired there were 37 would-be suppliers. From these applicants a short list of possible suppliers was prepared, and that list was drawn up by November 1997. These selected offers were then subjected to an extensive process of examination, analysis, discussion and provisional conclusion by successive committees in the Ministry of Defence, each one in turn examining and assessing the other's conclusions. If, after such a process, both eventually agreed on a particular requirement and a particular possible supplier of that requirement, a further short list of these w","label":0}

She said several square kilometres of the city of Bam were searched by the South Africans so that local authorities could move  in heavy machinery, confident that there were no survivors and bodies trapped beneath the rubble. \"The experience gained from working with this type of building material in collapse situations is invaluable because some areas in  South Africa have a similar type of building material and construction technique\". \"We now have the technical experience of how to deal with these situations should there be a similar type of collapse in South Africa,\" she said. Botis added that the emotional support the team gave the local people should not be underestimated. \"Us being there showed them that people are prepared to travel halfway around the world and they are not alone. There are also diplomatic benefits such as the strengthening of ties between South  Africa and Iran,\" she said. She said having being part in the rescue operations has also built stronger relationships between South Africa and other international rescue teams. The death toll confirmed by the United Nations stood at 28,100 and injuries were estimated at 35,000. On Thursday night the search and rescue phase was officially declared over, said Botis.

Investcom is based in Beirut and is also listed in Dubai. MTN said in a statement here: \"The MTN Group and Investcom LLC today (Tuesday) announced a landmark deal to create the pre-eminent  mobile operator in the emerging markets of Africa and the Middle East. \"The companies have reached an agreement on a transaction through a recommended offer in which the MTN group will offer to acquire the entire issued share capital of Investcom for a total of  5.526 billion dollars (4.3 billion euros),\" the company said. The offer was priced at 3.85 dollars per share in cash, with shareholders also offered a cash and share alternative, MTN said adding that the share-price was based on Investcom's closing share price on Friday. M1 Limited, a company with a controlling interest of 70.6 percent in Investcom, had \"irrevocably undertaken to accept the cash and will become a shareholder in the MTN Group\", the company said. MTN would become the largest mobile operator in Africa and the Middle East and one of the largest players in the world, operating networks in 21 countries with a total of more than 28 million subscribers. MTN group chief executive Phuthuma Nhleko said: \"We are delighted with this transaction which delivers the next stage in the MTN Group's emerging markets growth strategy. \"It substantially enhances MTN's growth prospects, securing a number of important new markets for the MTN Group.\" Investcom chief executive Azmi Mikati said that the deal \"represents the ideal platform for Investcom to realise its goal of  being a leading emerging markets telecom enterprise\". The offer is subject to approval by MTN shareholders and the fulfilment of certain conditions, the company said, without giving details. Last year, Investcom reported revenues of 903 million dollars and a net income of 196 million dollars, MTN said. Johannesburg-based analyst Reg Rumney said that the deal was one  of the biggest by a South African-listed company in recent years. \"What this deal shows is that outward investment is becoming very important for South Africa in the modern world,\" Rumney told AFP. \"You have to go global or risk being swallowed up,\" he said. Last year, South African mobile phone companies looked back on a  bright 12 months, having left a large footprint on the African continent as cellphones became the communication tool for millions from Cape to Cairo. \"The reason why they've done so well is because they are probably better adapted to conditions on the continent, which is a high-risk, high-reward market,\" Rumney told AFP. The Johannesburg-listed MTN had more than 23 million subscribers  across 10 countries in Africa at the end of 2005. The deal with Investcom is to add Benin, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Liberia and Sudan in Africa to the list, as well as enlarge its business in the Middle East, notably in Syria and Yemen.

Bell Pottinger will not be eligible to reapply for corporate membership of the PRCA for a minimum period of five years,\" PRCA said in a statement embargoed for Tuesday morning. The United Kingdom (UK) and Middle East and North Africa region-based (MENA-based) public relations and communications membership body said it imposed its \"most serious sanctions\" on Bell Pottinger, \"following the industry regulator's investigation into Bell Pottinger's work for Oakbay Capital in South Africa\". The investigation followed a complaint from the Democratic Alliance (DA) in July. \"Bell Pottinger has brought the PR and communications industry into disrepute with its actions, and it has received the harshest possible sanctions. The PRCA has never before passed down such a damning indictment of an agency's behaviour,\" PRCA director general Francis Ingham said. \"This outcome reflects the huge importance that the PRCA places on the protection of ethical standards in the business of PR and communications.\" PRCA said that Bell Pottinger has been found to have breached the PRCA Professional Charter and Public Affairs and Lobbying Code of Conduct, in respect to the PRCA Professional Charter clause 1.1 and clause 4; and the PRCA Public Affairs and Lobbying Code of Conduct clause 12 and clause 13. PRCA launched its investigation on July 5, following a complaint from the DA. The DA and Bell Pottinger were able to present written and oral evidence at a hearing of the PRCA Professional Practices Committee on August 18, PRCA said. \"The Professional Practices Committee was unanimous in its view that the Professional Charter and Codes of Conduct had been breached, and recommended to the PRCA Board of Management that Bell Pottinger's membership be terminated. The Board approved that recommendation unanimously,\" PRCA said. PRCA said that Bell Pottinger was given five days to appeal the Board's decision, and to submit an appeal to the PRCA. The PRCA Board of Management met again on Monday, to make a final ruling. During the hearings, Bell Pottinger acknowledged to the Committee that work undertaken fell short of the company's own standards and the Committee found that it failed to maintain and protect its own reputation and that of the profession as a whole. \"Certain aspects of the manner in which the Bell Pottinger campaign was conducted on behalf of Oakbay Capital fell so far short of expected standards that an apology was issued by James Henderson, CEO, in which he described the social media campaign highlighting economic emancipation to be 'inappropriate and offensive': 'these activities should never have been undertaken'. The partner in charge of the campaign was dismissed and two employees were suspended,\" PRCA said. \"The Committee formed the unanimous view that the manner in which the Oakbay Capital programme was conceived and delivered indicated a failure on the part of Bell Pottinger's senior management to oversee and control a campaign which, in the Committee's view, required the highest level of scrutiny and supervision, given the sensitive political and social environment in which it was activated.\" The Committee was not convinced with Bell Pottinger's explanations during the hearing which was not in accordance with implementing \"opinion-forming programmes in sensitive or volatile climates\", it said. Bell Pottinger was accused by the DA of fomenting racial division in South Africa by spreading false claims against white captains of industry and former finance minister Pravin Gordhan to divert attention from mounting allegations of state capture by the Gupta family. In July, the company fired partner Victoria Geoghegan, who lead the Gupta account, and three other employees and apologised for having run an \"inappropriate\" media campaign on behalf of Oakbay. It had terminated its contract with the Guptas in April. Bell Pottinger has lost several big South African clients, among them Richemont. The luxury goods company is headed by Johann Rupert, who was allegedly among those targeted to draw attention away from the Guptas. \u2013 African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The 10th International Forum on Ecological Civilization, organized around the impetus organic Marxism gives to ecological civilization and the balance between an ecological civilization and economic growth, gathered over 150 scholars and environmentalists from around the world. \"We are in the midst of a discussion, begun by Philip Clayton, about 'organic Marxism,'\" said John Cobb Jr., a 91-year-old member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The forum with the theme of \"Organic Marxism and Ecological Civilization\" concluded on Saturday. \"Philip wrote the book 'Organic Marxism' for everyone, but, I think, especially with the needs and possibilities of China in view. It is my impression that the title and the project are playing in China just the role Philip wanted,\" Cobb said. Cobb, a philosopher and environmentalist, said organic Marxism seeks to build a society in which all may work and all workers will flourish, not only economically, but also in other ways. \"I believe it will come closer to realizing the real concerns of Marx than any previous form his followers have developed,\" he said. Cobb said China is more open to serious discussions of ecological matters than the United States is. The deeper meaning of democracy, that the people as a whole can inform the government's decisions, \"may well be better realized in China than in the oligarchy that the United States has been becoming.\" \"China is working as hard, or harder, than any of the others to deal responsibly with the frightening global problems,\" he said. Clayton noted at the conference that China may be an inspiration for the pursuit of ecological civilization. \"The term 'ecological civilization' was born in China. It began to have influence more than 10 years ago, and it was written into the Five-Year Plan in 2012,\" he said. The author said that Americans and others around the world immediately recognized that the Chinese idea of ecological civilization expresses the goal that all countries and cultures must move toward. \"For 10 years, our International Forums have promoted real action based on this ideal,\" Clayton said at a public plenary of the forum. Zhu Guangqing, secretary general of the China Ecological Civilization Research and Promotion Association, said environmental pollution, ecological damage and resource shortages have become global problems, seriously threatening human survival. \"Such crises are forcing the transformation of civilization. Eco-civilization advocates the harmonious co-existence of human and nature as a win-win between development and environment. It carries forward the advantages of industrial civilization while overcoming the disadvantages,\" he said. Zhu expounded on the latest developments in China regarding the pursuit of ecological civilization. In the past five years, the country's annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.8 percent, with annual energy consumption growing by 3.6 percent per year. Energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 18.2 percent, saving 860 million tons of standard coal, equivalent to 1.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. In 2015, China's resource output rate increased by 16 percent from that of 2010. More than 600 million tons of crop stalks have been used, with a comprehensive utilization rate of over 80 percent. Energy consumption has been further optimized, with non-fossil energy now accounting for 12 percent of primary energy consumption, while the share of coal decreased from over 80 percent to 64.4 percent. At the conference, Chinese farmer An Jinlei was honored with the Cobb Common Good award for spending over 20 years cultivating organic food and exploring biology agriculture in the northern province of Hebei.

Contract sales of the crop opened on Thursday, and earnings from the sale of the crop are also expected to increase by 16 percent. Before 2000, tobacco was grown by less than 4000 white tobacco farmers, but now more than 66000 black tobacco farmers have ventured into the lucrative crop. The crop is Zimbabwe's top foreign currency earner, after mining, and the 5.8 percent increase in harvest compared to last year will give the country a lifeline against biting foreign currency shortages. Some 186.3 million kgs were sold last year, mostly to China, South Africa and Belgium. The Tobacco Industry Marketing Board (TIMB), which regulates operations in the industry, has licensed three auction floors for the 2018 marketing season; Tobacco Sales Floor (TSF), Boka Tobacco Floors (BTF) and Premier Tobacco Auction Floor (PTAF). Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) statistics show that last year, tobacco generated $1 202 247 760 in export proceeds. China is expected to remain the top source market for tobacco exports. At the launch of the 2018 tobacco marketing season in Harare on Wednesday, acting President Constantino Chiwenga assured farmers that government would support the sector. \"The government has extended the tobacco contract model to the same category of the maize production programme, commonly known as command agriculture, which has recently been extended to cover wheat, soya beans, livestock, fisheries and wildlife production. So tobacco as from this coming season will also be on command agriculture,\" he said. The inclusion of tobacco under command agriculture is part of government's efforts to increase production. Ciwenga said tobacco had earned a strategic position in the Zimbabwean economy because of its contribution to gross domestic product and foreign currency earnings. He said more than three million people depended on the industry for their livelihoods. At the opening of sales on Wednesday, the bidding price for the first bale started at $6 per kg before going down to $4.90. Chiwenga said value addition was also needed for tobacco, which could increase earnings and provide an import substitution. \"Currently, 98 percent of all tobacco production is exported. Tobacco processing is partially being done by merchant companies, who remove stems and tips from the leaf before it is shipped abroad. This adds to a mere 30 percent to 50 percent to a crop's final export value. Value-addition would not only create the much-needed jobs in the downstream processing industries, but also result in increased earnings from the processed product,\" he said. \"The country would also significantly benefit from attained by-products such as pesticides and hair products. This will inevitably help reducing the unsustainable import bill through import substitution.\" He commended the tobacco contract companies for financing 82 percent of the crop in 2017\/18 season. In his monetary policy statement last month, RBZ governor John Mangudya said the tobacco input finance facility would be increased to $70 million this year from $28 million in 2017. Mangudya announced plans to float a Diaspora tobacco financing bond to raise funding. TIMB chairperson Monica Chinamasa said unfavourable weather conditions might affect the tobacco brought to auction floors. \"We had hailstorm damage as well in the beginning and then drought, excessive rains, so it depends at what stage the tobacco was at that time. It could impact, but we are praying that the impact is not too much,\" she said. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Stella Mapenzauswa","label":0}

Police were already heavily regulated, from induction to retirement. There was a code of conduct and a multitude of regulations on how they had to behave and dress. Training alone was not the solution to abuses, he said. \"You must love the Constitution.... You must love democracy, because there is no money that can compensate anybody's life.\" Petros said the buck stopped with him in the province. Earlier, the seminar heard that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) had probed 4923 cases against police officers in 2011\/2012, including 720 deaths in police custody, or deaths as a result of police action. According to a paper published in the ISS \"SA Crime Quarterly\" in March 2013, the police employed 199,345 people at the end of 2012. This included 157,475 police officers. The rest were support staff. Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said not all the deaths were directly related to police action and many had to be seen in context -- for example a shooting during a cash-in-transit robbery. In some cases, people could have been injured before police arrived, and in others they could have committed suicide. The latter was concerning because officers would have been negligent if they had not removed items such as shoelaces or belts from people detained. For the 2012 reporting period, 88 Ipid cases related to domestic violence, 2320 to criminal offences, mostly grievous bodily harm, and 1795 were alleged contraventions of police standing orders. Compared with 2010, deaths in police custody had dropped by 10 percent. All provinces, except the Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga, experienced decreases  in reported cases. For 2011\/2012, there were 36 convictions in court, which ranged from fines to a life sentence, and 38 acquittals. However, Dlamini questioned the internal disciplinary processes which accompanied these cases. He said sometimes they concluded with a \"suspended dismissal\" after a court had already handed down a sentence for a death. \"Suspended dismissal? What is that?\" he asked, and added that police disciplinary measures might need to be reviewed, with union input. Updated figures are expected to be tabled in Parliament within a few weeks. ISS researcher Johan Burger said \"bad apples\" in the police were in the minority, but a Canadian study had found the \"bad apple\" defence was a factor in not taking action. He said police were armed and worked in an environment where there was likely to be violence, which increased the risk of abuse occurring. The international average for murder was 6.9 per 100,000 people, compared with South Africa's 30.9 per 100,000. \"This in itself puts pressures on the police,\" he said. The increase in violent protests in South Africa, and the country's relatively high rate of crime increased the likelihood of abuses, he said. He did not believe that demilitarising the police, which recently adopted military-style ranks, would help, but that another change would make a \"laughing stock\" of the police. Instead it needed to address systemic problems, such as not having regular inspections, and a general lack of command and control at police stations, as had been shown in research.

Sanibonani, molweni, dumelang, thobela!  I take this opportunity to salute our traditional leaders, the descendants of the great warriors like \u00a0Soshangane, Shaka ka Senzangakhona, Mzilikazi kaMashobane, Moshoeshoe, \u00a0Makhado, Hintsa, Ngungunyane, Sekhukhune, Bhambatha kaManzinca and many more great warriors who led our people in combat against colonial forces.  I invoke all these heroes of the wars of decolonization because this year, we are celebrating 20 years of freedom from the yoke of apartheid colonialism.  Traditional leaders have a central place in the history of our country's liberation struggle.  You will recall that amakhosi were part of the very first executive of the ANC in 1912 in Mangaung at its founding conference.  Some of the traditional leaders who became honorary Presidents were Dalindyebo of the abaThembu, Montsioa of the Barolong, Lewanika of Barotseland which is part of eastern Zambia, Letsie II of Basutoland (now Lesotho) who was elected President, Khama of Bechuanaland (now Botswana) and King Dinizulu of amaZulu.  Given the role of traditional leaders in the genesis of our modern struggle,  when this ANC government pays its respects to traditional leaders, we are being  true to the history and traditions of the country and the movement.  Our traditional leaders have also participated fully in building the new free democratic society.  Siyababonga kakhulu abaholi bendabuko ngeqhaza abalibambile ekwakheni lelizwe. Mkhulu umehluko. leNingizimu Africa esiphila kuyo isingcono kakhulu ukunale esasiphila kuyo ngesikhathi sobandlululo.  Indeed, our country has changed for the better. South Africa is a much better place to live in than it was before 1994.  Many of our traditional leaders can attest to that fact, having seen improvements in their own areas. In many villages now people have water, electricity and roads.  More of our people have been lifted out of extreme poverty. More people have  jobs. We have \u00a0expanded social grants to close to 16 million people, primarily orphans and vulnerable children, older persons and persons with disability.  We have further improved access to better education, basic services and health care.  Most importantly, freedom has restored the dignity of Black people, who were  treated as pariahs in the land of their own birth.  They now walk tall and with pride.  One of the founding fathers of our freedom, RV Selope Thema summarised the living conditions of black people during the period of apartheid colonialism eloquently in an article dated 25 July 1953;  He said;  \"In those days the black man was treated as a beast of burden. He was knocked and kicked about with impunity.  In the magistrate`s courts his voice was hardly heard and his evidence hardly believed.  \"He was stopped at street corners by policemen demanding the production of his pass and his tax receipt. He was not allowed to walk on the pavements and had to dodge motor cars in the streets.  \"He was not allowed to travel first, second or third class on the trains.  He travelled in trucks almost similar to those used for cattle and horses. ?. Politically he had no voice in the making and administration of the laws''...  The successful struggle for freedom has changed all that. The rights of all South Africans are guaranteed and protected by the Constitution of the Republic.  And that is because of the selfless struggles of thousands of our people, including the heroic struggles of many traditional leaders during various phases of our struggle.  We have indeed achieved a lot as a people. We have a good story to tell about how South Africa has changed since 1994.  Esteemed members,  Last year I requested that we must work closely together to build our country.  That collaboration is bearing fruit.  I will mention just a few programmes.  We appreciate your participation and the advisory role you continue to play in the drafting of Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) of Municipalities.  In this manner, matters that are important to traditional communities find expression in the development plans of municipalities.  We also appreciate the constructive work you do in supporting the criminal justice system to build safer communities.  We welcome the partnership between the South African Police Services and the  National House of Traditional Leaders, which is intended to reduce the levels of crime. I am aware that the National House has participated actively in strategies aimed at fighting violence and crime in rural areas.  To mention a few, traditional leaders participated in the development of the  Rural Safety Strategy and the draft Community Policing Strategy which will contribute towards the reduction of violence and crime in our society.  We are also happy that traditional leaders are active in the campaign to eradicate violence against women and children.\u00a0  The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, the National Prosecuting Authority and the National House of Traditional Leaders have joined  hands and developed the Safety Planning Programme for Victims of Domestic Violence which was launched last year.  This initiative encourages victims to think ahead and plan for their safety so as to escape unharmed from violent attacks.  Government has intensified the campaign and we are very happy that communities cooperate by reporting cases of domestic violence and also the violation of women and children in general.  To ensure swift justice for victims of abuse, government has established 57 regional courts across the country that are dedicated as sexual offences courts, with 22 due for completion by the end of the current financial year.  Together let us build safer communities for women and children, in this era of freedom and democracy.  Chairperson,  We also welcome the relationship of the National House of Traditional Leaders with the Department of Correctional Services on the reintegration of offenders in Society.  This programme is intended to reintroduce into society, those former offenders who have served their time, who wish to be accepted back into their communities.  It is not an easy matter and the guidance and support of traditional leaders  is valuable. The reintegration is intended to eradicate crime by ensuring that offenders do not commit crime again.  Esteemed members  Your contribution to the fight against HIV and AIDS is also laudable.  Our country has become a model country in the fight against this scourge because we work together as many sectors to promote treatment, prevent new infections and fight the stigma associated with the disease.  I am told that next month there will be a joint summit of the National House  of Traditional Leaders, the South African National Aids Council and the Department of Health, focusing on intensifying the role of Amakhosi on the fight Against HIV and AIDS.  Chairperson, we are aware that to perform most of these tasks traditional leaders require infrastructure.  In this regard, I would like to announce that government will, during this year 2014, begin refurbishing kings councils as well as 78 traditional councils  which are located within the 23 identified districts which require special infrastructure intervention across the country.  The refurbishments will be done through the Municipal Infrastructure Support  Agent and the support will continue up until 2019, the end of the next term of government.  Chairperson  Esteemed members,  I have mentioned only a few areas of collaboration.  There are many other activities in which the National House works with government. We must build on this good story of working together to build our country.  We must continue working together even in the next term of government, as we  take South Africa forward.  In the next administration after the elections, we will continue to focus on  education, health, creating decent work, the fight against crime and corruption  as well as rural development and land reform.  We will work closely with members of this august House in the implementation  of programmes in these priority areas.  Rural development, agriculture and land reform are matters that are very close to your hearts. They are important to government as well. This is one priority area that we will need to take forward together.  We appreciate the fact that traditional leaders have joined government to promote farming to our rural population.  Traditional leaders have participated actively in various provinces in the launch of the \u00a0agricultural food production programme, the Fetsa Tlala Integrated Food Programme and other related programmes.  The Minister of Finance announced in the Budget Speech yesterday that to boost food production and reduce reliance on imports, the Fetsa Tlala initiative aims to bring an additional one million hectares into cultivation by  2019, creating 300 000 jobs.  Asibakhuthaze abantu balime, bafuye ukuze sixoshe indlala. Uhulumeni uzobasekela abantu ngaloluhlelo olubizwa ngokuthi e-Fetsa Tlala, olwakhelwe ukuxosha indlala ngokugqugquzela ukulima.  On a macro level, Government will continue to comprehensively support the work of farmers, emerging and established farmers. Their contribution to the nation is enormous.  Chairperson,  With regards to land reform, as you requested, we are finding ways of ensuring your participation in the Land Management Commission, the Land Rights Management Board and the Rural Development Agency so as to ensure that you are able to influence decisions for the benefit of rural communities.  We are also continuing with the process of speeding up and improving land reform programmes.  The ANC government has spent about 20 billion rand since May 2009 in acquiring approximately 1.8 million hectares of land for Restitution and Redistribution purposes.  Work continues to acquire more land and to improve the ownership patterns of  land in our country, to correct the historical injustice of 1913.  History was made in the National Assembly this week when the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Bill was passed. The Bill will enable the re-opening of the land restitution process.  The Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Bill sets a new deadline for land claims to 31 December 2018, replacing the previous deadline of 31 December 1998. Therefore many who were excluded by the cut-off date now stand a chance of regaining their land.  Chairperson,  Of concern to many has been the need to support beneficiaries of land reform. Beneficiaries plead that government should not desert them once they obtain land.  It is for this reason that in 2010, government, through the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform introduced the Recapitalization and Development Programme to support those who have been given back their land.  The aim of the Recapitalization and Development Programme is to support black farmers financially so that these can be fully productive.  To date, a total of one thousand three hundred and fifty farms or 1.1 million hectares have been revitalised. \u00a0This is ongoing work, and we as government will continue to work with traditional leaders to make the programme  succeed further.  Chairperson,  Esteemed members,  We have identified tourism as one of our job drivers in the New Growth Path.  It is key to promoting income generating activities even in the smallest rural towns, especially since most small towns have a rich history and heritage.  The institution of traditional leadership is a major role player and contributor to the growth of the cultural tourism industry.  We have a lot to showcase, from cultural events to showing the way of life of various communities.  I am happy that the National House is already formalizing the building of cultural and heritage tourism.  I am informed that the National House of Traditional Leaders has engaged with its sector partners such as the Freedom Park, the Pan South African Languages Board, the South African Heritage Resources Agency, Indoni South Africa, the National Interfaith Council of South Africa, Kara Heritage Institute, the Department of Tourism, Department of Arts and Culture to promote  heritage and cultural tourism.  We applaud this proactive move.  The National House has also signed a number of Memoranda of Understanding with these institutions so as to give effect to their partnership and to realize their objectives.  We are moving in the right direction as these activities will boost the rural economy.  People do not have to go to the cities to find work, they can create jobs where they live.  Chairperson  Esteemed members,  It is evident to all that this august house has done a lot of work in promoting social cohesion, creating decent work and cementing the cultural values of our country.  South Africa is indeed a much better place to live in now than it was before  1994. There are more opportunities for all, regardless of where one lives, be it urban or rural areas.  We continue to face challenges but life will also continue to change for the  better, as there are clear policies and programmes on the table, designed to build a better life.  On the 7th of May, our people will go to the polls again to elect a government of their choice, and take South Africa forward.  A record of 25 million people have to date registered to vote. This number is much higher than the last election.  This demonstrates that our people appreciate the gains of freedom. They appreciate this right to vote that many paid for with their lives.  When we vote, we will also be celebrating the good story of how we run elections in our country.  We pride ourselves on the fact that this country has run smooth, efficient and credible elections since 1994.  We commend the Independent Electoral Commission for putting our country on the map as one of the success stories in the world with regards to running credible elections.  We encourage all those who are registered, to go out and vote on the 7th of May.  We know that traditional leaders will support the electoral authorities to ensure that everything goes smoothly in various traditional authorities, as they always do.  Esteemed members,  We thank you for the hard work and the collaboration in the past five years.  Let us celebrate our hard won freedom, and make a pledge to take South Africa forward towards a prosperous society.  Fellow South Africans, let me express our shock and sadness at the tragic death of four police officers and a truck driver between Mokopane and Polokwane  this morning. The police are still investigating the explosion.  Their families are in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.  Esteemed chairperson,  It is my honour and privilege to declare the National House of Traditional Leaders open.  God Bless Afrika.  I thank you.

Warrant Officer Bongani Ndikho, 42, who is out on warning, was in charge of prisoners appearing in court, when the alleged incident happened in the holding  cells at the Wynberg Regional Court in Cape Town in March last year. He appeared before magistrate W Rixana, who at the request of prosecutor Simone Liedeman, ordered him to report at the Valkenberg psychiatric hospital for an assessment as an outpatient, and to be admitted as an in-patient as soon  as a bed became available. The prosecutor said she had a medical certificate as well as a psychiatric letter stating that Ndikho had severe depression, and was unable to focus on the proceedings. He also had difficulty in interacting with people, poor memory, and concentration, she said. As Ndikho stepped out of the dock, he complained to the court that he had been chased through the streets in Bellville after his previous appearance, by a media cameraman. He lamented that he was unhappy about the media presence in court, and did not want his photograph in the newspapers. Ndikho added: \"This is a corruption case, and the media presence affects me and my ailing mother.\" He said the photographer had chased him for about 500m, and \"they abuse their right\". Ndikho asked the court for help, and said he did not want to be chased through the streets. The magistrate said the media had to bring a formal application if they wished to take photographs, or TV footage, in the courtroom. However, the court had no control over what happened outside, the magistrate  explained. He said the court could not make an order that it could not enforce. He said Ndikho had the right to privacy, and he needed to discuss the problem with his lawyer, Chantelle Morgan, who could launch a civil suit on his  behalf, for damages against the newspaper that published his photograph without  his permission. With Ndikho in the dock was prisoner John Maggot, who allegedly gave Ndikho the R150 bribe. Ndikho faces two counts of corruption. One relates to the alleged R150 bribe  for sex, and the other alleges that he received additional bribes totalling R12,000 to smuggle dagga parcels to Maggot. Maggot similarly faces two counts of corruption. Both also face one charge each of dealing in drugs. The charge sheet tells of a number of cellphone sms messages, allegedly arranging for dagga in parcels to be given to Ndikho, to smuggle to Maggot in the court holding cells, and for the alleged payment of bribes. In one sms, Ndikho is alleged to have said if the bribe was \"not a block (R1000), don't bother coming\". The prosecutor alleges that Ndikho deposited R12,000 into his bank account on March 27 last year. The case was postponed to August 18, for the psychiatric assessment.

For a city that prides itself in being one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, this is unacceptable.  While the Independent Democrats wholeheartedly supports the government's 6% economic growth target, the party wonders how this can be achieved in Cape Town when the City is neglecting our biggest money spinner; tourism. For every three tourists that visit  the Mother City, one job is created, so the seriousness of this issue is unavoidable.  Beach constables, who were initially appointed to improve safety  levels on the city's beaches, are now faced with a wide range of new responsibilities, including such arbitrary tasks as dog impoundment and general municipal law enforcement duties. This has happened because the City has incorporated them into the general Metro Police structure. One of the beaches that face a new threat of lawlessness is Fishhoek beach, which is visited by tens of thousands of tourists and locals every year. Police statistics show that every week an average of four cell phones are stolen at Fishhoek beach, a figure that will almost certainly treble in the face of decreased police presence in the area. In addition, the fact that beach constables now work from 8am to  5pm means that people only have a general after hours number they can call in case of an emergency. In the past beach constables worked until 7pm, making the beaches safer for late evening strollers, joggers and others frequenting these areas. After hours squatting, which is already taking place, will increase further and street children, who should be cared for in shelters, will have free reign. A visit to the beaches in the south  is enough to show that the latter is already a serious problem. Mugging is already increasing on our beaches, so action needs to  be taken before we go back to the days when murder and rape were nasty and regular occurrences. As a City Councillor I hope and trust that together we can steer  this City in the right direction.

The programme \"concerns all salaried staff at Renault Samsung Motors except for the 1,000 in research and development, and design,\" a spokeswoman said. She added that the company employed 5,667 people at the end of 2011. Workers would be let go \"on a voluntary basis, with severance pay of up to two years pay depending on seniority,\" the spokeswoman said. Renault had said earlier in the day in South Korea that it would offer some Samsung staff voluntary retirement owing to sluggish sales, but did not say how  many might be affected. In the seven months to July, Renault Samsung Motor's sales fell by an annualised 34 percent to 93,919 vehicles. Analysts cited a lack of new models and stiff competition from South Korea's dominant Hyundai-Kia group. Employees who agree to leave are also to get two years of education fees for  children and other allowances. Renault Samsung has been shutting down its sole plant for several days a month since December. The site in the southern port of Busan has an annual production capacity of 300,000 vehicles. In July, the Renault-Nissan Alliance promised to invest $160 million to build Nissan models at the Busan plant from 2014. The factory is expected to turn out around 180,000 autos this year.

It reported several injuries but denied reports that as many as four people were killed. Students in the South Pacific nation have been demanding for weeks that Prime Minister Peter O'Neill resign because of alleged corruption and mismanagement. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she had been advised by the Australian Embassy that police shot students in Port Moresby, the capital, as hundreds prepared to march from the University of Papua New Guinea to Parliament. \"I know that students have been shot, but we're still trying to determine whether there have been deaths and how many have been injured,\" Bishop told reporters. \"We call on all sides to be calm and to de-escalate the tension and certainly call on all sides to respect the peaceful and lawful right to protest.\" Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that a Papua New Guinea lawmaker told Parliament that four students had been killed and seven wounded. Joe Duhube, personal assistant to lawmaker Gary Juffa, told The Associated Press that Juffa spoke to students after the shooting and was told \"one of the students got killed instantly and others are in serious and critical condition.\" Papua New Guinea Police Commissioner Gari Baki, however, said no deaths had been reported. In a statement, Baki said around nine students were receiving medical treatment at Port Moresby General Hospital for a number of injuries. O'Neill issued a statement saying he was told that a small group of students became violent, threw rocks at police and \"provoked a response that came in the form of tear gas and warning shots.\" Five people were treated at the hospital and were in stable condition, with the circumstances that led to their injuries still being investigated, O'Neill said. The hospital declined to comment. There were also complaints that police attacked students at a roadblock outside the university. Waliagai Olewale, a reporter at the local National Broadcasting Corp., said armed police in 20 vehicles clashed with hundreds of students. Most students were eventually chased back onto the campus late in the morning, she said. Olewale could not confirm that anyone was shot. \"There was a lot of force that was used on students,\" she told the AP. \"Students were pushed and shoved. They were beaten up. There were gunshots.\" She said National Broadcasting Corp. reporter Rose Amos lodged an official complaint saying she had been assaulted by police while reporting the clash. \"She was physically assaulted, she was punched in the stomach, thrown to the ground by police,\" Olewale said. Student Gerald Peni told ABC that police \"fired shots directly at the crowd.\" \"They fired tear gas. I was right in front and many of the students, they fell, they got injured,\" Peni said.","label":1}

The word \"chav\" has been coined to describe young Britons, among  them soccer hooligans, who dress in Burberry clothing to the embarrassment of company bosses. Shrugging off the impact of 'chavs', Cartwright said they had accounted only for a small proportion of Burberry's British sales. \"A lot of 'chav' followers were buying counterfeit Burberry goods, so it will have little impact on future sales,\" she added. \"Chav\" is said to originate from a mid-19th century Romany word \"Chavi\", meaning child. Burberry saw a seven-percent-rise in underlying sales -- on a constant currency basis -- to 167 million pounds (238 million euros, 315 million dollars) during the third quarter to January 1 compared with the same period a year earlier.  Retail sales were up six percent to 100 million pounds and wholesale sales up five percent to 49 million pounds. \"It's been a poor (Christmas) trading environment for all the high street retailers and the third quarter was weak,\" Cartwright said. Nevertheless, she said customers' response to the new spring products had been favourable and that the group expected \"mid-to-high\" single digit wholesale sales growth for Burberry famous for its invention of the gabardine waterproof raincoat and its kitting out of officers in the British armed forces during World War I, has revitalised its image in recent years.

Dube, 30, was found guilty last week of murdering six children and a woman, raping three girls and indecently assaulting boys.  Labuschagne was testifying in aggravation of Dube's sentence. He said denial of responsibility for the criminal acts, as in Dube's case, was seen as \"the first and largest stumbling block in any rehabilitation process.\" Asked what the motivation of jailing Dube was when there were no  prospects of positive rehabilitation, Labuschagne told judge Seun Moshidi that there was no option but to jail Dube as he was a threat to society. Labuschagne also said there were possibilities that more children could have been molested or even killed if Dube was never arrested. \"It is common for sexual serial murderers to escalate their crimes as time goes by... even if they were to receive the most desirable rehabilitation programme because their risk of re-offending increases with each passing year... as long as their sex drive remains.\" He said Dube's intelligence gained him the trust of his young victims. \"He had to have a sophisticated form of manipulation for him to get his victims to do what he wanted... going with him wherever he asked them to.\"  Just before Labuschagne took the witness stand, Dube's aunt Sibongile Mkhize told the court that her nephew had had a troubled childhood. She said Dube often stole from his grandmother and even skipped school until he dropped out when doing standard two. Mkhize pinned all the blame on Dube's paternal family, saying they had failed to carry out their traditional obligations. \"His father failed to perform imbeleko -- a traditional ceremony  -- for him and this led to his bad behaviour.\" She said the family was told this after taking Dube to spiritual  healers for help. But consulting the healers never helped as Dube's behaviour worsened. \"He started getting involved in housebreakings,\" Mkhize said. The housebreakings she referred to were confirmed when state prosecutor Joanie Spies said Dube was once sentenced to three months imprisonment for a housebreaking he committed at Ladysmith in January 1999. Apart from the 1999 conviction, he was also said to have served an 18 months term for attempted theft, also in Ladysmith. Dube, 30, was also convicted of 10 kidnappings, one theft, one robbery, one common assault and one assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. On Wednesday Dube swore at photographers who tried to take photographs of him -- even attempting to throw a bottle and a microphone at them. The hearing continues Thursday. Sapa","label":0}

While child poverty was decreasing, income inequality was rising, Cape Town University's Children's Institute (CI) said on Wednesday. This would have devastating effects on children's survival, development, and  life trajectories, the CI said in its annual publication, the South African Child Gauge 2012. \"It also means that high rates of inequality are likely to persist into the next generation,\" said senior CI researcher Katharine Hall. Hall said the country's law and policy-makers needed to look beyond merely tackling poverty if they were to create opportunities for children in the future. \"As children don't start off on an equal footing, policy-makers need to move  beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to tailor policies and programmes that help  close the inequality gap,\" she said. The latest report showed specific groups of children were exposed to this inequality. \"These included very young children, children with disabilities, poor children, and those living in rural areas, especially in the former homelands.\" Democratic Alliance MP Mike Waters said the report painted a grim picture of  the state of children in the country, adding he would call for a debate on the issue when the National Assembly sat next Tuesday. Waters said some of the findings showed that only one third of children were  living with both their parents. \"This confirms the inappropriateness of the Families Green Paper punted by the department of social development, which is centred on strengthening and promoting the nuclear family,\" he said. Some of the department's policies were not aligned to the needs of children. He cited the fact that there were 885,000 orphans in the country, while adoption rates remained low. \"A reply to a DA parliamentary question has revealed that the Register on Adoptable Children and Prospective Adoptive Parents (RACAP) currently only has 378 registered children available for adoption and 287 prospective adoptive parents.\" Sapa \/cp\/hdw\/dd\/jk","label":0}

The 12-nation euro bought as little as US{dollar}1.2018 - the lowest level since Aug. 30, when it bought US{dollar}1.1987. By midday it was back up to US{dollar}1.2051, slightly above the US{dollar}1.2047 it bought in New  York late Tuesday. The British pound rose to US{dollar}1.8091 from to US{dollar}1.8075. The dollar was up slightly against the Japanese yen, at 109.36 yen from  109.32 yen. Analysts said the euro's lethargy was part of concern about the European Union's political future ahead of a key summit Thursday and Friday. \"There's a lingering gloom in Europe,\" said Lee Ferridge, chief currency strategist at London's Rabobank. \"The 'no' votes against the constitution, will the ECB cut interest rates - it's all lingering.\" Members of the 25-nation bloc at are loggerheads over the budget, coming on the heels of 'no' votes to the constitution by France and the Netherlands. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warned that failing to overcome the deadlock over the EU's constitution could leave the bloc facing \"permanent crisis and paralysis.\" Markets also were looking ahead to U.S. reports on inflation, security flows and industrial production coming this week. The dollar had opened weaker against other major currencies on recent days' mixed U.S. economic data. On Tuesday, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell by 0.5 percent in May, the first decline in nine months.  The U.S. Labor Department said wholesale prices fell by 0.6 percent  in May, the biggest decline in more than two years. That compared to hefty increases in March and April, which raised worries that inflation was threatening to break out of the moderate pattern of the past several years - something that would boost the prospects of U.S. interest rates rising further, and in turn likely lift the dollar. The euro rose to an all-time high of US{dollar}1.3667 at the end of last year on concerns about the wide U.S. trade and budget deficits  before slipping back. Sapa-AP","label":0}

The request -- which the SABC learnt about through the media-- was \"irregular, unacceptable, and an attempt to interfere with its editorial independence,\" said SABC spokesman Paul Setsetse. Earlier on Wednesday the DA told the media it was seeking an urgent meeting with SABC news editorial staff over the SABC's election coverage policy. DA election spokesman Douglas Gibson said the meeting would be \"to discuss and hopefully resolve the problem\". However, the SABC saw the request as an \"attack\" by the DA. \"It brings into disrepute the integrity of the SABC\", said Setsetse. He said it led to the conclusion that the DA had refused to accept the findings of the independent regulator on its complaint.  The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa)  on Monday had ruled in favour of the SABC in a complaint that the broadcaster had contravened its editorial code by providing live coverage of a speech by President Thabo Mbeki on the day of the launch of the African National Congress' election manifesto. Since then the SABC had also refused to cover a DA \"critique\" of  ANC manifesto pledges. Gibson said that the broadcaster had an obligation to expose the  voting public to a range of views, and was \"flagrantly violating\" that obligation. \"Thanks to SABC's refusal to air that debate, millions of South Africans are being denied their right to a diversity of views over issues that are crucially important to them,\" he said. He said a debate over key policy areas and the future direction of South Africa was precisely what an election in a democracy was all about. Setsetse said the DA's accusation that the SABC was compromising  the prospect of a free and fair election was \"unsubstantiated and grossly unfair.\" \"In this regard, as with all other attempts by other political parties to interfere with its editorial independence, the SABC repudiates this latest accusations by the DA.\" Sapa","label":0}

The gas blast happened just after midnight at a mine in Linfen city,  a big coal mining area in Shanxi province, the State Administration of Mine Safety said on its website. \"Thirteen miners have been rescued and sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, 40 have been found dead and 74 are trapped,\" the statement said. No reasons were given for why the explosion at the Ruizhiyuan mine occurred but the administration said an investigation had been launched  even as rescue operations were underway. \"We must immediately organise the police force, place the mine boss and other people responsible under detention, seal the mine offices and  freeze its bank accounts,\" the statement said. China's coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world, with safety standards often ignored in the quest for profits and the drive to meet the nation's booming energy demands. The central government has previously spoken out against endemic corruption in the coal mining industry, with a particular concern the collusion between local government officials and businessmen. More than 4,700 coal miners died in China last year, according to official figures -- a fatality rate of nearly 13 a day. Independent labour groups put the real toll at closer to 20,000 annually, saying many accidents are covered up. The mine safety administration said the Ruizhiyuan mine had a license to produce 210,000 tonnes of coal a year, but no details were given as to whether that output was being exceeded, as is often the case. One local farmer said residents were being kept from approaching the  mine. \"The mine is locked down by all kinds of departments, including the police, no one can get near,\" said the farmer, who refused to identify himself after being contacted by AFP by phone. Meanwhile, the official Xinhua news agency reported that at least 11  workers were missing after the entrance to an illegal iron and gold mine well collapsed in neighbouring Hebei province. The accident in Chengde city occurred on Monday, the report said, while not explaining why it was only reported on Thursday. In the worst reported coal accident this year, 172 miners were killed in August when their mine in eastern China's Shandong province flooded after a nearby river burst its banks following heavy downpours. Another nine people died in a nearby mine in the same circumstances. Despite the bad weather, the accidents were largely blamed on bad management, state-media reports said at the time. Those tragedies were the worst reported coal mining disasters in China since an explosion at a colliery in the northeastern Liaoning province in 2005 claimed 214 lives. Sapa-AFP","label":0}

During the past year, countries in the eurozone have put in place various emergency policies and reforms, but this simply meant that there was little room for further measures, warned Angel Gurria, the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \"It's not a very pretty picture,\" he said Saturday at the meeting in the Swiss Alpine village. As he was speaking at the last major discussion round of this year's forum, many seats were empty. Canadian central bank chief Mark Carney quipped that many of the forum's 2,500 attendees had apparently gone skiing, believing that the risk of a new crisis erupting in the eurozone had completely disappeared. Earlier in the week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that the  eurozone's economy would shrink further this year, at a rate of 0.2 per cent, posing risks for the rest of the world, which depends upon trade with Europe. The IMF's global forecast of 3.5 per cent of growth for this year, would depend heavily not only on Europe, but also upon efforts by Japan and the United States to bring their public finances in order and whether China boosts domestic demand, according to IMF chief Christine Lagarde. At the same time, she warned of a public backlash against austerity measures  in crisis-hit southern European countries, which could lead to a slowdown of reforms. \"It is not going to be a stable landscape and a walk in the park for 2013,\" she said. Social problems stemming from the past years of crisis are not limited to Europe, but are an issue in many industrialized countries, where millions are still unemployed. As there was no more room for more emergency measures, the OECD's Gurria said, Western governments should now focus on social issues like unemployment. \"There's still too many victims,\" he said, referring to the fallout of the crisis. Leaders of emerging countries expressed concern in Davos that Europe was strangling itself and the global economy with its overly tough austerity plans. \"It's not going to work,\" South Africa's National Planning Commission Minister Trevor Manuel said. \"We're not going to have growth\" in the eurozone, he added. Governments of countries like South Africa, Russia or Malaysia effectively used Davos to effectively stage road shows for investors, promoting the fact that the world's economic growth is created mostly in emerging markets. At one discussion, African leaders took issue with the theme of a Davos panel that was titled \"De-risking Africa.\" \"Is Africa really more risky than any other region in the world?,\" South African President Jacob Zuma asked.

Other precious metals rose, too. Energy prices finished lower, though, after Kurdish officials said Turkish troops that entered Iraq early Tuesday had returned to Turkey, easing concerns that the tensions  would threaten oil supplies from the region. Agricultural futures fell. Global inventories of platinum have grown increasingly tight as automakers try to meet demand, particularly in Asia and Eastern Europe.  Meanwhile, in South Africa, a major platinum producer, mine equipment problems, accidents and maintenance have contributed to a production decline this year. Demand for platinum, used in jewelry and catalytic converters in automotive exhaust systems, has also surged due to tighter emissions standards. Congress on Tuesday approved an energy bill that calls for the first increase in automobile fuel economy in more than 30 years. President Bush said he plans to promptly sign the legislation, which would increase mileage by 40 percent to 35 miles per gallon. \"Much will depend on how robust automobile production will be next year,\" said Jon Nadler, a senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers. \"That's really becoming the component of demand in this marketplace, almost exclusively.\" Investor demand for the metal has also been strong in recent months,  analysts said. Platinum prices have climbed 31 percent this year and have roughly doubled in four years. January platinum gained {dollar}11.70 to settle at {dollar}1,515.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after reaching a peak {dollar}1,526.40 an ounce in early morning electronic trading. February gold futures added {dollar}8.10 to close at {dollar}807.40 an ounce, while March silver futures picked up 18.5 cents to {dollar}14.165 an ounce. Efforts by the European Central Bank and Bank of England to pump more than {dollar}500 billion into money markets to keep banks flush with cash  also boosted precious metals, said James Steel, an analyst at HSBC. Massive cash injections can raise investor concerns about inflation. \"I think it helped gold more than platinum,\" he said. Industrial metals traded mixed, meanwhile. Nickel, zinc and lead prices rose on the London Metal Exchange, while tin and copper prices fell. Nymex copper for March delivery fell 0.45 cent to {dollar}2.8845 a pound. Energy prices finished lower. In its weekly report Wednesday, the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration is expected to report falling stockpiles of crude and distillates, including diesel fuel and heating oil, and rising inventories of gasoline. Analysts expect U.S. inventories of crude oil dropped by 1.5 million  barrels last week - which would be a fifth straight week of decline. On  average, analysts expect distillate fuel inventories to shrink by 400,000 barrels and gasoline stockpiles to rise by 700,000 barrels. Falling supplies at a key Nymex physical delivery terminal in Cushing, Okla., however, could affect prices later in the week. Lower inventory there is viewed as a symptom of a tight market. Light, sweet crude for January delivery declined 14 cents to {dollar}90.49 a barrel on the Nymex. Gasoline futures declined 3.11 cents to {dollar}2.3043 a gallon, while heating oil futures fell 4.25 cents to {dollar}2.5554 a gallon on the Nymex. Elsewhere, agricultural futures moved lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.

(AP) \u2014 Donald Trump on Friday slammed Hillary Clinton as \"heartless\" for backing restrictions on gun ownership that he said would leave Americans in high-crime areas unable to protect themselves. He also challenged Clinton to follow his lead and release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Trump's remarks came at the National Rifle Association convention in Louisville, Kentucky. The gun rights' organization endorsed the presumptive Republican nominee ahead of his remarks, despite Trump's previous support for measure like an assault weapons ban that the NRA vigorously opposes. Trump centered much of his remarks on Clinton, claiming she would seek to \"abolish\" the Second Amendment if elected president. He called her a \"Heartless Hillary\" \u2014 a new nickname for the likely Democratic nominee \u2014 for backing restrictions aimed at reducing gun deaths, saying her proposals would instead law-abiding citizens at risk from criminals. \"She's putting the most vulnerable Americans in jeopardy,\" Trump said. \"That is so unfair and that is so egregious.\" Clinton has said she supports the Second Amendment but that safety measures are needed to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. She has called for expanding background checks to sales at gun shows and online purchases, and for reinstating a ban on assault weapons. Trump backed an assault weapons ban, as well as slightly longer waiting periods for gun purchases, in a 2000 book. He's since said such bans don't work and has also called for making it easier for law-abiding citizens to carry guns for self-protection. On Friday, he reiterated his call for ending \"gun-free zones\" and touted the list of potential Supreme Court nominees he released this week as a sign of his commitment to upholding the Second Amendment. \"I'd like to call for Hillary Clinton to put together a list also,\" said Trump, predicting her potential justices would be a \"day and night\" difference with his. _ Follow Julie Pace at","label":0}

Suu Kyi, in her first visit to Thailand since taking power in November, was due to meet with workers at the Mahachai port in Samut Sakhon province, where she was expected to hear concerns from members of the million-strong Myanmar diaspora that forms a significant part of Thailand's manual labour force. The Thai military junta however forbade access to tens of thousands of workers that had made their way to see her and only allowed several hundred pre-approved workers into the venue. The rest were stuck in the rain outside hoping to catch a glimpse of their hero as Thai police escorted her into the venue. \"There are thousands waiting outside but the government only let in several hundred workers from nearby factories,\" said Andy Hall of the Migrant Workers Rights Network. \"This is ridiculous.\" In Bangkok, the military also shut down a panel at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand which was holding an event to discuss the treatment of the Rohingya, an ethnic-Muslim minority in Myanmar that faces discrimination. The Myanmar government's treatment of Rohingya's has been a concern for human rights defenders and a point of criticism directed at the Suu Kyi government, which has refused to even refer to the Rohingya by their self-designation, but instead chooses to call them the Muslim-population in Rakhine state. Suu Kyi will meet with Prayut Chan-ocha, the head of Thailand's military government, on Friday to discuss bilateral ties and the working conditions of migrant workers.

The awards, presented annually, would recognise a group of 31 individuals, celebrating their achievements, sacrifices, and their contribution to unity and nation-building. The orders are divided into five categories: the Order of Mendi for Bravery, the Order of Ikhamanga, the Order of the Baobab, the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of OR Tambo. The Order of Mendi for Bravery will be bestowed upon South African citizens who have performed acts of bravery. For 2016, the order will be bestowed in silver to 10 individuals including Maqashu Leonard Mdingi, who is recognised as the man who recruited Zuma to the African National Congress (ANC), and Major General Jackie Refiloe Sedibe who became an Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) guerilla at age 17. Those to be awarded posthumously are anti-apartheid activist Hermanus Gabriel Loots who exposed brutality in ANC camps in the eighties; ANC and MK veteran Ulysses \"Goggie\" Modise who was instrumental in forming the Military Veteran Association in the Northern Cape; MK commander Peter Sello Motau who was murdered by named members of the Eastern Transvaal Security Branch; member of the ANC Revolutionary Council from 1976 to 1980 Wilson Ndaliso Boy Ngcayiya; ANC organiser and MK commander Joseph \"Mpisi\" Nduli; General Secretary of the Civic Association of the Southern Transvaal Sam Ntuli; founding Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency Sizakele Sigxashe; and, military veteran Major General Peter Lesego Tshikare.

On Monday, at the International CES gadget show, the company unveiled Dolby Vision, a technology that increases the brightness and contrast of TV sets. Prototype models will be on display from TV manufacturers such as Sharp and TCL. Standard TV sets emit about 100 nits - a unit of brightness roughly equivalent to one candle per square meter. As a reference, a 100-watt lightbulb  emits 18,000 nits. Dolby says its prototype monitor can put out 4,000 nits. San Francisco-based Dolby Laboratories Inc. says the brightness isn't blinding because only the brightest parts of an image are rendered that way. Increasing the contrast of these images helps bring out more subtle color variations and richer details, Dolby says. The company says it expects TVs featuring Dolby Vision to be available for purchase later in 2014. Part of Dolby's solution is improving the signal that gets sent to TVs in the first place. Dolby says it is working with several video streaming partners  including Microsoft's Xbox Video, Amazon Instant Video, Netflix and Vudu. Video  streams using Dolby Vision will use 12 bits of data per pixel, up from today's standard 8 bits. The higher data rate means more of what is captured by filmmakers in high-end digital cameras will end up on screen, even for sets not upgraded to handle the load, said Dolby's senior director of broadcast imaging, Roland Vlaicu. Software can trim the higher bit count for older sets. \"A lot of information is lost in the TV signals we have today,\" Vlaicu said. Increasing the bit rate also raises the bandwidth required to handle the stream. While there are physical limitations on the brightness of mass-production TV  sets, viewers who tested the system preferred images rendered as bright as 10,000 nits, the limit of what Dolby Vision will support, Vlaicu said. Consumer televisions in the near future will be able to emit 2,000 nits of brightness while remaining in line with Energy Star low-power requirements, he said. Sapa-AP \/kd","label":0}

Rain delayed the start of the contest and reduced the game to a 48-over-a-side affair. Sri Lanka won the toss and inserted the South Africans in to bat and got off to the perfect start as Laura Wolvaardt was dismissed for a golden duck in the second over. Although still a teenager, Wolvaardt has a mightily impressive average of 45.77 from 38 ODIs \u2013 her wicket was a big one. Trying to get away to a quick start, Wolvaardt cut a Udeshika Prabodhani delivery straight to Inoka Ranaweera at gully. Prabodhani struck again, bowling Lara Goodhall for 12. South Africa were 29\/2 in the 10th over and in a spot of bother. In came Van Niekerk to join Andrie Steyn at the crease. Together, over the course of nearly 25 overs, they put on a superb 116-run partnership to put their team into a strong position. Steyn fell for 75 lbw to Ranaweera while van Niekerk pushed on with minimal support \u2013 the highest score after Van Niekerk and Steyn was Marizanne Klapp's 13 \u2013 to reach her maiden ODI century. She also became the fourth South African woman to pass 2,000 runs in the format. In the end South Africa ended their innings on 225\/7 from their 48 overs. A decent score, but with stronger lower-order support it could have been more. Sri Lanka got their chase off to somewhat of a flier. They lost their first wicket, that of Anushka Sanjeewani, in the 11th over with the score already on 57. Ahead of the required rate with plenty of wickets in hand, Sri Lanka would have been content with their start as captain and key batter Chamari Athapaththu came to the crease. Then, in a crucial passage of play, Van Niekerk dried up the runs with her leg-spin before bowling her opposite number. She finished with outstanding figures of 2\/26 from her 10 overs to go with her hundred earlier in the day. From then on, despite a 47 from Prasadani Weerakkody and 49 from Shashikala Siriwardene, wickets fell at regular intervals taking away any kind of momentum from the Sri Lankan chase. The run-outs of Oshadi Ranasinghe and Prabodhani in the 44th over didn't help Sri Lanka's cause as they eventually ended up seven runs short of their target. Ultimately, it was Van Nierkerk's all-round display that tipped the contest in South Africa's favour. \u2013 African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Michael Sherman","label":0}

Nevertheless, leaders have agreed to reconsider the overall amount of the fund in March -- largely over fears that rose last year of a requirement for Italy or Spain to need financial aid.

Toronto's previous best was the five straight wins at the beginning of the season from Oct. 28 to Nov. 4. Despite the current winning streak, Raptors head coach Dwane Casey continues to be focused on getting the team to the level that he hopes the team can reach. \"We got to go game by game, possession by possession,\" said Casey in Toronto. \"We could easily have been on the other side of that. We know we're not doing some things well, turning some balls over. We have to find other ways to win.\" With the win, Casey's squad improves to 27-15 on the season, an identical record as last season after 42 games. The team ended with a franchise-best 49 wins last season. Despite the duplicate records, this year's squad is on pace to surpass last season's due to overcoming an unfavorable first-half schedule and an improved defence. Due to being part of the NBA Global Games in London, United Kingdom last week and hosting the All-Star game later in February, Raptors has played just 19 of their first 42 games at Air Canada Centre, compared to the 23 played last season. Toronto has overcome this difficult schedule with 14-9 road record, the second-best road record in the league. Toronto's defence was 27th in the league last season, allowing opponents to shoot 46.0 percent from the field. This season, Casey's squad have held opponents to 43.7 percent, good for eighth best in the league. While the improvement on defence may have not been on display against Boston, who shoot 50.6 percent, coach Casey is optimistic that the team will return to form soon. \"It's important that you win ugly,\" said Casey. \"We gotta make sure we get out defensive mojo back.\" Raptors are in the midst of a season-long seven game home stand and hope to continue their winning ways.

Despite objections by an energy lobby group against the generation licence application by the government power utility NamPower for its subsidiary Kudu Power Pty Ltd and British company Tullow Oil pulling out as project partner last month, Kudu would go ahead. \"It is a national project and will achieve Namibia's aim of self-sufficiency  of power supply,\" Erastus Kahuure, permanent secretary in the ministry, told a press conference. \"We are aware it is a complex project on the upstream and downstream side and Tullow's pull-out will not impact project development timelines,\" Kahuure added. Other investors were interested in filling the gap left by Tullow, the government official noted without disclosing names. \"Zambia's independent CEC Energy company will buy 300MW and the power export  agreements' term sheets were provided to South Africa's national power utility Eskom as second off taker,\" said NamPower's managing director Paulinus Shilamba  at the press conference. Last week, Leake Hangala -- Shilamba's predecessor at NamPower --publicly questioned the economic viability of the US2.6 billion mega project. \"We must ask as business people and as taxpayers if the Kudu gas project is economically viable,\" Hangala told the national energy forum hosted by the Namibia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NCCI). Similarly a newly emerging Consumer Advocacy for Energy (CAE) group officially objected to NamPower's electricity generation licence application at  the Electricity Control Board (ECB), citing \"fears of monopoly and electricity tariffs becoming unaffordable for consumers\". Last month the ECB informed NamPower to re-apply for the licence with more information to be contained therein. Tullow's withdrawal from the upstream part of the project -- bringing the gas to shore from the ocean bed 140 kilometres off Namibia's coast -- was due to its wish to concentrate on other oil and gas projects. The Kudu gas field was discovered around 1970 by Shell. It has proven reserves of 1.3 trillion cubic feet. The upstream part of the project costs around US1.3bn. Construction of the Kudu power station near Oranjemund along the southern coast of Namibia will cost around another US1.3bn. Sapa  \/str\/jk\/ks","label":0}

Ngwenya CAPE TOWN, December 15 (ANA) - The South African Cabinet's decision to go ahead with nuclear procurement worth a trillion rand and bypass parliamentary processes doesn't make sense and is \"irrational\", the Democratic Alliance (DA) said. Gordon Mackay, the DA Shadow Minister of Energy said late on Monday that this decision to \"proceed with the procurement of 9600 MW of additional nuclear capacity is utterly inexplicable\" especially given the country's current economic climate. He noted that government still has to \"complete and make publically available a detailed cost analysis, detail the impact of nuclear procurement on the long-term price of electricity for consumers, or await the findings of the Cape High Court as to the legality of the pre-procurement phase (which itself is yet to be completed).\" Mackay questioned how could government steam ahead with a nuclear deal \"without critical information.\" He said this decision to do so was \"blatantly irrational in light of South Africa's very real and worsening economic challenges following the President's bungle in the dismissal of Minister of Finance and the subsequent muddle.\" Questions of the legality of Cabinet's decision have arisen. Mackay said such a decision should be in line with the Public Finance Management Act which \"requires National Treasury sign-off of any major public procurement.\" He said to date, other than the R200 million \"for preparatory work for potential nuclear procurement during the Medium Term Policy Statement (MTBPS) in November \u2013 no such sign-off has been provided by National Treasury.\" Mackay said Cabinent should be mindful that the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court ruled unambiguously that \"decisions of government must be seen to be rational to be considered valid.\" On Monday, the new Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan announced that South Africa would go ahead with the nuclear deal. Mackay said the DA was concerned \"Parliament is being sidelined by Cabinet\" in the country's biggest public procurement deal. He recalled that in August earlier this year, Energy Portfolio Committee Chairman Fikile Majola \"promised public hearings on nuclear procurement before the end of 2015\" and in October, National Treasury Director-General Lungisa Fuzile \"stated unequivocally that government would not proceed with the Nuclear New Build programme without parliamentary approval.\" Neither of these events have taken place, Mackay said. \"It is clear that President Zuma and his Cabinet are intent on by-passing parliamentary oversight in their ill-advised pursuit of an additional 9600 MW of nuclear capacity,\" he added. Mackay said the DA \"will not stand for this\" and would take their concerns to the Minister of EnergyTina Joemat-Pettersson and the Portfolio Committee Chair. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF) expressed its condolences to the Ngakane family in a statement on Wednesday and commended the invaluable contribution Ngakane made to the film industry in South Africa and the continent. Chief Executive Officer of the NFVF, Eddie Mbalo said: \"Dr Ngakane's passion for this industry was contagious, and his dedication has inspired generations of film makers, including myself.\" He said Ngakane dedicated his life and experience for the advancement and development of the film industry in the country and  the continent. \"The South African film industry and the NFVF owe their existence to him.  \"We are relieved that we were able while he was still alive to initiate a scholarship fund, named the Dr Lionel Ngakane Scholarship fund, with an annual R1-million committed by the NFVF, which will live on as legacy to his contribution to the development  of film in South Africa,\" he said. \"We will really miss his passionate and vigorous contribution to  the development of FRU policy and strategy for the distribution of films from the continent\" said Film Resource Unit spokesman Mike Dearham. Ngakane, 75, was instrumental in paving the way for the recognition of African cinema internationally. He brought recognition for African filmmakers through his participation in the  conceptualisation of the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), which he served as a bureau member and regional secretary. Ngakane's role in the development of film in South Africa included his membership of the Reference Group for the drafting of the White Paper on film for the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. The White Paper led to the drafting of the National Film and Video Foundation Act, which led to the formation of a statutory body.  Ngakane served the Foundation as a councillor from 1999 to 2003,  as an advisor to the M-Net's All Africa Film Awards, and as a member of the panel drafting Co-Production Treaties with Canada and  France, spending over 51 years working in radio, theatre, film and television. He started his media career in 1948 as a journalist with the Zonk and Drum magazines in South Africa. He then moved to the film industry in 1950 as an assistant to Zultan Korda, producer\/director of Cry The Beloved Country. The film launched his acting career in which for the next 30 years he did theatre, television and film in Britain.  During this period he also wrote and directed several films including the award-winning short feature film Jemima and Johnny and several political documentaries on South Africa and the African  continent. In his lifetime Ngakane received several accolades from his own and other countries for his work in the film industry.  This included Officer the Del Ordre National from the government  of Burkina Faso, MNET's Marie van Rensburg Lifetime Achievement Award, and The Freedom of the City of Amiens, France. Ngakane is survived by two brothers and three sisters. Sapa","label":0}

New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in April, sank $1.41 cents to $101.17 a barrel. Brent North Sea crude for April fell 98 cents to stand at $108.02 a barrel in London late afternoon deals compared with Friday's close. \"The sharp decline in Chinese exports in February is fuelling fears that the  global economy could be slowing down,\" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. \"That said, the February data are distorted by the Chinese New Year celebrations, meaning that the situation will only become really clear once the  figures for March have been published.\" Chinese official figures released Saturday that showed the world's second biggest economy recorded an unexpected $22.98 billion trade deficit in February. The figure compared with a surplus of $14.8 billion in the same month last year, and a median forecast of an $11.9 billion surplus in a poll of 13 economists by Dow Jones Newswires. \"Any time there are concerns about China's growth and the numbers point that  way, that will obviously put downward pressure on oil prices, especially Brent prices,\" David Lennox, resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney, told AFP. The Chinese government said the weak trade figures were a result of \"sharp fluctuations in the monthly growth rate as well as the monthly deficit\" during the country's holiday season.

Fears of an immediate armed conflict due to Russia's incursion into the Crimean peninsula have receded but oil prices remain supported over concerns US  and European sanctions on Moscow could wreak turmoil in markets.

{"id":"5db56b94ee1f20001746448a","url":"SAPAP_20151109101227000_181486.txt","text":"China promises action on climate ahead of Paris talks By JOE McDONALD BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China has changed course and emerged as a leader in curbing greenhouse gas emissions six years after it was accused of obstructing the last high-level climate talks in Copenhagen. Heading into this month's Paris meeting, the world's biggest source of climate-changing gases has yet to accept binding limits. But it has invested in solar, wind and hydro power to clean up its smog-choked cities and curb surging demand for imported oil and gas. That contributed last year to a surprise fall in coal consumption. Beijing's about-face began last year when President Xi Jinping, in a joint declaration with his American counterpart, Barack Obama, set a 2030 deadline for emissions to stop rising. This June, Beijing promised to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 65 percent from 2005 levels. In September, Xi pledged $3.1 billion to help developing countries combat climate change. Beijing \"recognizes it should take a different responsibility than a few years ago,\" said Li Shuo, senior climate officer for Greenpeace East Asia. China's status as the leading source of emissions makes its cooperation essential for any global climate deal to succeed. Until now, China has been exempt from limits. But pressure on Beijing intensified as its share of world carbon output rose last year to 28 percent, double the U.S. level. Forecasts show its historic total will soon pass the United States as the biggest. Washington and Beijing \"had fundamental disagreements in Copenhagen\" over China's obligations, said Li. \"I think this has been resolved over the past two years.\" Without a formal commitment, China is making faster progress than most countries as a side effect of Communist Party efforts to nurture more self-sustaining growth based on consumer spending and technology instead of trade and energy-hungry heavy industry. Pollution has \"created immense and escalating social pressures for change,\" said researchers Fergus Green and Nicholas Stern in a June report for the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics. In 2005, communist leaders launched a campaign to improve efficiency in an economy that devours two to three times as much energy as the United States, Europe or Japan per unit of output. Older power plants and steel mills were closed. Utilities were ordered to invest in wind turbines and gas-fired generation. Last year, China spent $83.3 billion on renewables, or nearly one-third of the global total, according to a report by the Frankfurt School and the U.N. Environment Program. The United States was a distant second at $38.3 billion. The slowdown in steel and other heavy industries has prompted suggestions China can beat its 2030 deadline. \"Emissions are likely to peak by 2025, and could well peak even earlier than that,\" said Green and Stern in their report. \"China's emissions could fall strongly after their peak.\" China has reduced carbon intensity, or emissions per unit of economic output, by 33.8 percent from 2005 levels, the Cabinet planning agency said in a June letter to the Paris organizers. That is \"a greater rate than most other countries have ever been able to achieve,\" said Xiaochen Zhang, associate director for climate change of the group Business for Social Responsibility, in a report in October. In Copenhagen in 2009, some participants complained China and India stymied global emissions reduction efforts, possibly for fear they might hamper economic growth. \"China wrecked the Copenhagen deal,\" wrote an aide to one negotiator in The Guardian newspaper. Since then, growth of renewables has allowed China to raise economic output without boosting emissions. China leads the world in hydro and wind capacity and is No. 2 behind Germany in solar, according to the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century, a Paris-based alliance of environmental groups. Last year's coal consumption fell 2.9 percent while the economy grew 7.4 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. It was the first reduction in 14 years, according to the China National Coal Association, an industry group. Still, China is forecast to rely on coal for at least 60 percent of its power for the foreseeable future. China accounted for 80 percent of new coal generating capacity worldwide over the past decade, according to Greenpeace. \"The extreme growth of coal power generation, especially in China, undercuts many successes with renewables,\" said the group in a report. The Chinese Cabinet's energy plan through 2020 promises to hold coal's share of energy to 62 percent, down from last year's 66 percent. It calls for doubling the share of energy from non-fossil fuels to 20 percent by 2030. But that will only bring China into line with today's global average. And Beijing has yet to say how high emissions might be allowed to rise before the 2030 peak. It is too early to assume last year's decline in coal use is permanent, said Greenpeace's Li. He said Chinese leaders might face pressure in coming years to stimulate China's cooling economy by launching resource-intensive construction projects.","label":0}

Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa was quoted in the privately- owned Zimbabwe Independent as saying that the government had asked the United Nations Development Programme for financial help, Mugabe said last week that voting for the 120 contested seats in  the 150-seat legislature would be held in March next year. However, Chinamasa said that given the \"economic upturn we think  we will now be able to to meet the costs from our own resources.\" He also rejected appeals for comprehensive electoral and constitutional reforms and said parliamentary elections would be held under the same laws as the presidential vote in 2002. \"As far as we are concerned, the next election will be run on the basis of the existing electoral laws,\" he said. Mugabe's victory in presidential elections in March 2002 was widely dismissed by independent international observers as the result of rigging and violent intimidation. Western diplomatic sources confirmed Friday that the withdrawal of the request came after the U.N. said it would first have to send  a team to examine the country's electoral system and political environment. They said the team had been due to arrive in Zimbabwe on Wednesday next week. The sources said that the U.N. would have provided support only if there were full-scale changes to the system. They said the U.N. would also insist on \"significant progress\" in talks between the MDC and ZANU(PF) to try and resolve the country's crisis. \"It's in the national interest and for regional security that we  ask for assistance from the U.N.,\" said Reg Matchaba-Hove, head of the independent Zimbabwe Election Support Network. \"We don't just need them for money. We need them for international and domestic credibility. \"There is need for substantial election reform,\" he said and called for the repeal of press-gag laws and draconian security legislation passed in 202. \"If we don't, you cannot talk of free and fair elections. We will be back to square one, the 2002 elections. It would contribute  to political instability here and beyond our borders.\" \"It is impossible to have free and fair elections under the current electoral set-up,\" said Lovemore Madhuku, chairman of the National Constitutional Association which is pressing for constitutional reform. \"We expected this.

Fortuin was the guest of honour at the SAFA Grassroots and Live Your Goals Football Festival, held this past weekend at the Mossgas Stadium in Mossel Bay. She was grateful to SAFA for bringing the event to the region: \"We all know that Mossel Bay is a developing town and we believe with such projects coming to our area we will also be able to develop the young ones. \"We want them to stay away from the life of crime, and sport is one way of doing that,\" added Fortuin. Prior to the festival, local coaches from all seven Local Football Associations (LFA) of the region underwent training to equip them with the necessary skills to work with children. The 30 participants were tutored by SAFA Instructor Boebie Williams, who was assisted by Maud Khumalo of the Banyana Banyana coaching team. The coaches were also encouraged to apply their newly-acquired skills outdoors with local schoolchildren, in preparation for the football festival. Grassroots is an activity for children between the ages of 6 and 12, in which they are introduced to the game at an early age. The Live Your Goals programme is very similar to Grassroots, but focuses on girls. It is a FIFA-sanctioned project, launched at the FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany in 2011. The main objectives of the programme range from increased participation of girls and women in football, to creating the best platforms for women's football to thrive. However lofty the ideals, there was a low turnout of children at this event and organisers have some work to do to promote, publicise and facilitate events of this nature in the future, perhaps providing transport to and from the event for children from surrounding areas. Ms Fortuin watched the event with the SAFA vice president, Elvis Shishana. He observed: \"We all saw there was a lot of interest from the children that came through, we have to find ways and means of keeping the interest and not lose them to other sporting codes,\" said Shishana. Shisana was fulsome in his praise for the efforts of the coaches in preparing for and facilitating the event, thanking them for their enthusiasm and dedication. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The probe into the activities of Robert Ashley Lee was initiated  at the requests of Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, as well as Rep. Sue Kelly, both Republicans. Lee had worked at Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, where he was the lead examiner for Riggs. Shortly after he retired from the banking agency in October 2002, he took a job with Riggs. \"We found no evidence to suggest Lee had improperly entered into  negotiations with Riggs Bank while an employee of the OCC,\" according to a document from the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General. \"Nor did we find any other criminal violations by Lee for attending meetings between OCC and Riggs Banks as a Riggs official.\" Gilbert Schwartz, who represents Lee, welcomed the outcome. \"We are very happy. It is a complete vindication of him. We are pleased  to see the government confirmed our long-standing view that Mr. Lee's actions were always proper and he scrupulously followed the law.\" According to the document, the assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia \"declined criminal prosecution of Mr. Lee for conflict of interest because of the lack of evidence of a federal violation.\" The document also said that the FBI had closed its case  file \"on the Lee matter with no further action.\" The Associated Press obtained the document through a Freedom of Information Act request. The AP received the document Friday. The investigation was conducted jointly by the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney Office for the District of Columbia. Last year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed  a record {dollar}25 million (?21.4 million) civil fine on Riggs for alleged violation of laws to prevent money laundering. In April, the Federal Reserve approved the acquisition of Riggs Bank's parent by PNC Financial Services Group Inc. Lee was placed on administrative leave on Aug. 9, 2004, the document stated. He was then issued a termination notice effective on May 13, as were other Riggs Bank employees, the document said. Sapa-AP","label":0}

The authoritative International Food Policy Research Institute said even without climate change, 113 million children under 5 years old will be malnourished in 2050 worldwide. With climate change, the figure would be 20 percent more. As many as 15 million of those additional malnourished children would be African. \"The negative effects of climate change on crop production are especially pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia,\" the report concludes. The institute, part of a global network devoted to using science  to improve farming, called on governments and donors to invest in research, irrigation and rural roads. These areas are seen as key to helping small-scale farmers produce more and earn more by getting more to market. Gerald Nelson, a senior International Food Policy Research Institute researcher and lead author of the report, said he hoped negotiators meeting later this year in Copenhagen will approve at least $7 billion a year in spending to help farmers adapt to climate change. The Copenhagen talks were to produce a pact to replace the Kyoto  Protocol, which expires in 2012. Nelson, speaking to reporters ahead of the report's release, acknowledged it was \"an open question what the final outcome will be in Copenhagen.\" A series of preliminary talks have deadlocked over industrial countries' refusal to commit to sufficiently deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions or provide billions of dollars to poor nations to help them adapt to climate change. Nelson and his fellow researchers said the greatest investment is needed in sub-Saharan Africa, where infrastructure is weak and the majority of the poor depend on farming for their livelihoods. In South Asia, 14 percent less rice would be produced due to climate change, the researchers predicted. In sub-Saharan Africa, 10 percent less corn would be harvested. Institute scientists looked at climate change scenarios developed by the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Both models predict higher temperatures, but differ on how that will affect rainfall. The International Food Policy Research Institute's food supply and demand projections, which take into account population growth and a crop simulation model, also were incorporated into the study.

The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading eurozone shares declined 0.23 percent to 3,654.65 points. The euro stood at 1.2797 dollars. Japanese share prices rose for the fourth day in a row on Tuesday when overnight gains on Wall Street provided another boost to already upbeat market sentiment over the domestic economy, dealers said. US shares had closed with gains on Monday in a holiday-shortened  session, with little on the corporate burner and investors appearing to shrug off an industry report showing a manufacturing slowdown. The auto sector was meanwhile in focus across Europe, with shares in Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler, Peugeot and Renault all declining. In Frankfurt, German car giant Volkswagen dropped 1.09 percent to 54.60 euros. Dealers said the fall was owing to the euro strengthening against the dollar, which makes the cars more expensive for customers paying in the US currency. German-US group DaimlerChrysler dropped 1.08 percent to 38.35 euros amid the strong euro and also after the auto giant said US passenger car sales fell 13 percent in June compared with the same month in 2005.

Jordan Lesotho's King Letsie III re-opened parliament Friday amid tight security, the first step in a peace deal aimed at ending a crisis sparked by an attempted  military coup. Opposition parliamentarians celebrated with song and dance on the floor of the legislature, as the chamber sat for the first time for four months. Prime Minister Tom Thabane had suspended the body in June fearing a vote of no-confidence that could have booted him from power. The re-opening of parliament is a key first step in a peace deal following an August 30 coup attempt and will lead to early elections in February 2015. The king, who is constitutionally restricted to a ceremonial role, thanked the international community -- and particularly the 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) -- for helping to diffuse the crisis. \"On behalf of the Basotho nation, I would like to express... our deep-rooted  gratitude for expeditiously coming to our assistance at this critical moment in  our political journey,\" King Letsie told the 120-member chamber, as the SADC mediator, South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, looked on. As the king filed out, followed by Thabane, his feisty opponents, led by former prime minister Pakalitha Mosisili, then filled the floor, singing and swaying. \"Democracy begins again,\" said one MP, Kotiti Diholo of the Democratic Congress. \"There was no longer democracy in this country, but now we can get back to representing our people.\" On August 30 Thabane fled the tiny kingdom, entirely surrounded by South Africa, hours before the military attacked police installations, in what was seen as part of an orchestrated putsch. Just hours before he had fired Lesotho Defence Force commander, Lieutenant General Tlali Kamoli, who still refuses to relinquish his command. Thabane returned accompanied by SADC police and officials, who have since hammered out a peace deal among Lesotho's sparring factions. Crucially, the opposition have agreed not to mount a no-confidence vote against Thabane while this parliament is in session. Instead, they allowed the parliament to re-open and to pass a budget, then officially dissolve in order for the country to prepare for early elections. But in a sign of on-going instability, officials cancelled the military parade that traditionally opens parliament. That also dodges the difficult question of who is in charge of the armed forces. While Kamoli refuses to step down, his replacement has required South African police guards after an attempt on his life was made during the coup. Sapa-AFP \/kd\/jje","label":0}

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.58 points (0.28 percent) to 10,988.53 and the Nasdaq composite shed 10.87 points (0.51 percent) to 2,112.11 in the first exchanges. The decline extended a pullback Thursday as jittery investors eyed the Federal Reserve's rate-hiking cycle, which increasingly looks likely to continue beyond next week's widely tipped increase.

Dick Green of Briefing.com said the market had finally grasped that the Fed would have to curtail economic growth in order to combat inflation. \"For too long, the market had hoped that the Fed would stop raising rates before there was much impact on the economy,\" he said. \"A more realistic assessment that recognizes the risk to the economic and earnings outlook in the second half of the year is now  incorporated into the price structure.\" Sapa-AFP","label":0}

Meanwhile, oil prices have hit record highs because of strong growth in demand and OPEC's failure to recognise that the world needs more of its oil, the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES) said in its monthly oil report. \"While the current level of prices represents a demand-led spike, a loss of production from Iraq (or any other producer of a similar size) could turn the situation into a fully-fledged crisis,\" the report said. \"OPEC's spare capacity is insufficient to meet continued strong demand growth and simultaneously cover the loss of Iraq's production. Small wonder that events in Iraq continue to worry the oil market.\" The CGES said the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has the capacity to boost production \"but remains paralysed by a misguided fear of triggering a price collapse\". The cartel \"needs to raise output to allow commercial oil stocks  to rise, reversing the serious erosion of stocks over the past three years\", the report said. Prices hit a new all-time high of 41.72 dollars in pre-opening electronic dealing in New York on Monday after a bomb blast killed the head of the Iraqi Governing Council. Oil prices have hit record high points above 41 dollars since Friday on fears of terrorism strikes in the Middle East and tight supplies of US gasoline ahead of the so-called \"summer driving season\" in the United States, when holidaying motorists take to the  open roads. OPEC might hold a formal meeting in Amsterdam this week to approve a hike in production meant to appease record high prices, the Qatari energy minister said Saturday. Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiyah told reporters that \"there is a big chance\" that an informal meeting of OPEC ministers on the sidelines of an energy summit due on May 22-24 in Amsterdam could become a formal meeting. OPEC, which produces about a third of the world's crude oil, agreed in March to cut output by one million barrels per day to 23.5 million bpd from April 1. The cartel's president Purnomo Yusgiantoro has said however that  OPEC has been producing two million bpd above the its ceiling since  last month's cut. Sapa-AFP","label":1}

RUGABER MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) \u2014 Dozens of FedEx jets queue up for takeoff at the airport here. Beale Street, the heart of the music district, hums with tourists. Yet the empty storefronts in Memphis' moribund downtown and the cash-advance shops strewn near its highways tell another story. It's a tale of two cities, all in one place. And it's a tale of two Americas: the one that national averages indicate has all but recovered from the Great Recession and the one lost in the statistics. The pattern is evident in cities and towns across America, from Memphis to Colorado Springs, Colorado, from Wichita to Jacksonville: The national numbers aren't capturing the experience of many typical people in typical communities. A key reason is that pay and wealth are flowing disproportionately to the rich, skewing the data used to measure economic health \u2014 and producing an economy on paper that most Americans don't recognize in their own lives. That disconnect has fueled much of the frustration and anxiety that have propelled the insurgent presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Again and again, primary voters who were most worried about the economy told pollsters that they had cast their ballots for Trump or Sanders, according to Edison Research, which conducted the surveys on behalf of The Associated Press and television networks. Trump's candidacy, in particular, has been driven by support in some of the most economically distressed regions in the country, where jobs have been automated, eliminated, or moved to other states and countries. It's in these places that the outsider message of an unconventional candidate promising a return to the way things used to be resonates most. Mike Williams voted for Trump in Tennessee's March primary, which the billionaire won easily. To many, it would seem that Williams is doing pretty well \u2014 he earns $22 an hour as a maintenance worker at an Owens-Corning factory, along with health care and retirement benefits. But his hourly pay has only recently returned to where it was a decade ago, when he worked as a welder. \"I feel like I'm going backward rather than forward,\" Williams, 51, said on a recent afternoon after finishing his shift. One reason he backed Trump, he said, is that he feels less secure than in the past, when more manufacturing work was available. \"I remember when you could quit a job today and go to work somewhere else tomorrow,\" Williams said. \"There was always someone hiring.\" The depth of that kind of insecurity after seven years of national economic expansion has caught many observers off guard. \"The political reaction to the economy leads me to wonder if we're looking at the wrong things,\" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust and former economist at the Federal Reserve. \"The averages certainly don't tell the whole story.\" ___ Consider incomes for the average U.S. household. They ticked up 0.7 percent from 2008 to 2014, after taking inflation into account. But even that scant increase reflected mainly the rise in income for the richest tenth of households, which pulled up the average. For most others, incomes actually decreased \u2014 as much as 6 percent for the bottom 20 percent, at a time when the economy was mostly recovering. Or consider employment. The U.S. economy has added a healthy average of roughly 200,000 jobs a month since 2011. Yet most have been either high-paying or low-paying positions. By the end of 2015, the nation still had fewer middle-income jobs than it did before the recession, according to the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. That reflects what economists call the \"hollowing out\" of the workforce, as traditional mid-level positions such as office administrators, bookkeepers, and factory assembly-line workers are cut in recessions and never fully recover their previous levels of employment. Part-time jobs surged in the recession, too, and remained high in the recovery, even while full-time work was slower to return. The number of full-time jobs has risen just 1.3 percent since December 2007, when the recession officially began. Part-time positions are up more than 12 percent. In Memphis, hiring resumed after the recession and the unemployment rate has dropped to match the national figure of 5 percent. But jobs in low-paying industries, such as retail, restaurants and hotels, are the only category to have fully recovered from the recession, according to Moody's Analytics. Higher- and middle-paying jobs still trail their pre-recession levels. In Millington, a Memphis suburb where Trump held a rally in February at a military airfield, residents complain that most of the available jobs are in the fast-food chains that dot Highway 51, the main thoroughfare. The rebound from the recession has been felt in vastly different ways not only by income levels but across geographic lines. Areas like Las Vegas that still bear deep scars from the housing crisis have lagged behind the nation's recovery. So have cities like Memphis that need robust consumer spending to fuel growth at the shipping and logistics firms that form the backbone of its economy. By contrast, cities like Seattle, Denver and Austin, Texas, with heavy concentrations of information technology, management consulting or other highly paid services, have enjoyed a disproportionate share of the job and income growth. In other words, the richest places in the country are making the economy look better than it actually is, while places like Memphis stagnate. In the first half of the recovery, jobs grew 5.6 percent nationwide. Yet in the wealthiest one-fifth of zip codes, hiring jumped 11.2 percent, according to the Economic Innovation Group think tank. For the rest of the country, total jobs increased just 3.3 percent. \"It's hard to find an average city,\" Tannenbaum says. \"There just aren't a whole lot right in the middle.\" The same is true for households. These data suggest that the post-World War II trend of a steadily growing middle class, lifted by broader national prosperity, is reversing. Slightly fewer than half of American adults now fall in the middle-class camp, according to the Pew Research Center, a vast shift. In 1971, 61 percent of households were middle class, according to Pew, which defines middle class as income between two-thirds and double the median household income. And while home prices have risen nationwide since 2012, they're still below their boom-era levels in most parts of the country. Since most middle-class wealth is in home equity, those families are poorer than they were before the recession. By and large, more affluent Americans are the ones who hold stock \u2014 and stock prices are back near record heights. ___ In Las Vegas, which is still recovering from its huge housing boom and bust, Tracy Brigida's husband, Michael, last summer lost his second job in three years. Tracy, 48, has been paying the bills by substitute-teaching while raising their two children, one of whom is autistic and is home-schooled. They still owe more on their Las Vegas home than it's worth, having bought it nine years ago. They hoped it would build wealth for their retirements. Now, it's a money pit. The couple initially supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's presidential campaign. But after Michael's latest layoff, they switched to Trump. Families like hers, she says, seem forgotten in the celebration of rosy national economic averages. \"This administration wants to tell us the economy is better and people are getting jobs,\" she said. \"But that's not my experience.\" With higher-paying jobs clustering in wealthier metro areas, business and political leaders in the weaker cities fight to attract and retain employers. Memphis has provided tax breaks to attract or keep 36 companies, including Electrolux, Mitsubishi Electric and Unilever. Community leaders have also focused on improving the education and skills of the area's workforce, which trail national averages. A Brookings Institution analysis found that three-quarters of jobs in Memphis require post-high school education or training \u2014 something that 40 percent of the area's adults lack. Rising automation at many warehouses is also undercutting efforts to create solid middle-income jobs. Memphis is a leading transport hub: In addition to FedEx, shipping firms such as UPS, DHL, and XPO Logistics have warehouses in the region. So do other companies like Nike. Yet Memphis still has 3,200 fewer transportation and warehousing jobs than it did before the recession. Contributing also to the decline of middle-income positions has been the rising use of temporary workers, whose ranks have surged 54 percent in Memphis since the recession ended while the area's overall jobs grew just 3.3 percent. City officials involved in workforce training say some of the unemployed have 25 years of work history \u2014 all of it through temp firms. Chris Rice, 29, has worked steadily in the Memphis region for the past 10 years, all at temporary jobs. Rice most recently worked as a forklift driver for Electrolux and for CEVA Logistics, a privately held warehouse and distribution firm. The CEVA job ended after the company lost a contract to distribute Microsoft's X-Box, Rice said during a job fair at a community center in Bartlett, a Memphis suburb. Rice said he was hopeful of getting a new temp job at an assembly plant owned by printer manufacturer Brother International. He was the only forklift driver at the job fair. Still, \"I'd love to have a permanent job,\" he said. \"I'm tired of going from temp agency to temp agency when there's no work.\" ___ Contributing to this report were AP staff writers Nicholas Riccardi in Las Vegas and Adrian Sainz in Memphis.

Ngo Gia Linh, a trade union official in the central Vietnamese port city of Danang, said workers at the Valley View Vietnam garment company  struck Wednesday to demand the company pay them their one-month-wage year-end bonuses before the start of Tet, the Vietnamese lunar New Year. Linh said the company had promised to pay bonuses before Tet. When workers had received no payment by Wednesday, they surrounded the office of Valley View general director Wong Sung Hsin and prevented him  from leaving Vietnam for the holiday. \"Fortunately, they didn't damage any company property,\" said Linh. \"They protested peacefully.\" Linh said after meeting with local authorities, the company said they committed to pay workers a 13th monthly salary before the weekend. \"Most of workers have received their money so far,\" said Linh. Local media said many of the workers had been counting on the bonuses to pay for bus and train tickets to return to their home villages for the Tet holiday. This is the third wildcat strike at Valley View in recent years, following one 2005 and another last September. All three were related to salary payments. There are no independent labour organizations in Vietnam, and by law, workers must have the approval of the official national labour union to strike. But the official union sees its role as mediating between companies and workers rather than taking sides. Vietnamese authorities reported 650 wildcat strikes last year, compared with 541 in 2007. Local media reports put the number at 762. Strikes rose due to rapid inflation in 2008, with prices rising 23 per cent over the course of the year. Prices for foodstuffs rose 42 per  cent.

Recent warm weather benefited cooler northern Europe where major producers France, Germany and Spain enjoyed a better growing season thanks to a mild winter and a warm spring. But a heat wave that started in May has cut yields in Romania where wheat will likely come in a fifth below average. Bulgarian maize could be down by as much as 40 percent. The 27-nation European Union should produce 276 million metric tons (304 tons) of cereals this year, 1.6 percent or 5 million metric tons (5.5 tons) below the average but 10 million metric tons (11 tons) more than last year. Overall wheat yields should be up slightly over last year, with the EU crop forecast predicting some 132 million metric tons (145.5 tons.) Yields for durum wheat - used to make pasta - should be above average in Spain, France and Germany and up by 13.5 percent across the EU. Bulgaria, Romania and Greece, however, will see their soft wheat yields fall by a tenth. EU soft wheat yields are expected to remain unchanged. \"Unseasonably high temperatures of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius (3 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the seasonal average across the growing season certainly had an impact in central and eastern Europe and the Balkan region,\" the EU executive's arm said. \"An extreme heat wave is still under way in Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania where both winter and summer crop yields are being affected.\" Northern Europe's luck ran out after the good spring with \"unseasonably high\" rainfall over the last two months throughout the North Atlantic and North Sea region, which has partly spoiled first harvests in Britain, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands as well as northern parts of France, Germany and Poland. The forecast expects barley yields to increase by 3.4 percent, with potatoes up 8.1 percent and sugar beet up 4.2 percent. Grain maize should fall slightly by 0.8 percent, with rape seed - used to make biodiesel - down 5.1 percent and sunflowers decreasing 3.4  percent. The EU forecast uses satellite and statistical data to predict the expected harvest for the year assuming that there will be no more \"extreme events\" to damage summer crops such as maize, potatoes, sunflowers and sugar beet.

With true transformation, as a country, SA could become an even greater force in world sport. Through proper development programmes by the national federations and good supporting systems, the wealth of sporting talent could be exploited with representative teams a natural outcome. Once the programmes were adequate, by the law of averages, the representivity of teams would normalise naturally. \"We must turn things around in the shortest period of time, but, not  at the expense of any of our athletes.\" There was no doubt that all sports loving South Africans, \"which is actually the entire population\", acknowledged the importance of representative teams, he said. \"Sport must belong to the nation; it is an integral part of our way of life, of our South African culture over which government, with its elected representatives, has also a serious responsibility.\" All sporting federations were autonomous, with the federations responsible for their day to day activities, including the selection of  national teams. \"Although we adhere to this practice, it does not distract government from pursuing our responsibility to accelerate transformation in sport, making sport accessible to all South Africans,  making more funds available to school sport and to put academy systems and sporting facilities in place that will assist talented athletes to reach their full potential.\" Sporting facilities and opportunities were still skewed, he said. Government wanted to correct this and ensure that national teams were representative of the total SA population. \"We want all our children to start from the same line.

Releasing the final version of its latest TB strategic plan, director general Thami Mseleku said the plan's goals were guided by international targets. \"Over the next five years, we will improve our case detection rate to 70 percent, cure rate to 85 percent and treatment success rate to more than 85 percent,\" he told a media briefing in Cape Town. The latest figures the department has show that the cure rate in 2006 was 57.6 percent, and treatment completion -- a vital factor in the fight against drug resistant strains of TB -- was 70.8 percent. The cure rate was just under 50 percent in 2001. The World Health Organisation, in its international Stop TB Partnership, has set goals of reversing the incidence of TB by 2015, and curing 85 percent of new cases by the same date. South Africa's fight against TB has been complicated by its massive HIV infection rate. The number of cases rose from 224,000 in 2002 to 342,000 last year. It is currently one of the four countries in the world -- the others  are China, Russia and India -- with the largest concentration of TB sufferers with diagnosed drug-resistant strains of the disease. Mseleku said that in addition to an extra R400 million set aside for  the fight against TB in this month's mini-Budget, the department had asked for additional funds in next year's main Budget. He said though the department was committed to the fight against the  disease, there was a general need for new TB diagnostics and drugs. With the attention being given to ordinary TB, he believed South Africa would be able to avoid an exponential increase in the occurrence  of multi-drug-resistant TB. He said the new plan acknowledged the close connection between TB and HIV\/Aids, and provided ways of dealing with the challenges of co-infection. According to the plan, one of its goals will be \"functional integration\" of TB and HIV activities in health facilities. \"The focus will be to increase HIV testing uptake by TB patients, CD4 testing and assessment of all co-infected patients, provision of treatment and preventive therapy for other opportunistic infections and  antiretroviral treatment for all co-infected patients,\" it says. The plan also aims to strengthen the DOTS strategy, to improve infection control, and to \"empower people with TB as well as communities\". Sapa","label":0}

Allergan called \"not true\" statements it said a representative of Public Citizen made about the death. \"A medical review of this actual case demonstrates that the patient passed away in the winter of 2004 from complications associated with staphylococcus pneumonia, not from a Botox cosmetic treatment the patient received 7 weeks earlier,\" Allergan said. Botox Cosmetic is approved for the temporary treatment of moderate to severe frown lines between the brows in people ages 18 to 65, Allergan said. The FDA has approved other forms of the drug to treat a limited number of more serious conditions. --- On the Net: www.allergan.com http:\/\/www.citizen.org\/publications\/release.cfm?ID=7559.

Pistorius, 29, was convicted of manslaughter for shooting Steenkamp through a toilet door in his home early on Valentine's Day 2013.

Perhaps an increase to the number of members in the United Nations Organization's Security Council from those states, which have come to a new level over the last few decades and have heavy authority in the world.

The need to reform the United Nations as a whole and the UN Security Council in particular has been discussed since the early 1990s. The organization's chief, Ban Ki-Moon, has repeatedly pointed out at changes that are needed within the United Nations. Many countries have called for reform of the UN Security Council, including Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Ireland and Russia.

{"id":"5dc272406c767a0017f2d2de","url":"SAP20130807S9355.txt","text":"An extensive crime intelligence network listened in on the Boeremag accused's conversations during their trial, the High Court in Pretoria heard on  Wednesday.  Jurg Prinsloo SC, for the accused, argued that this resulted in a miscarriage of justice. He said the court should make a number of special entries on the record reflecting irregularities during the trial which were not in accordance with the law and which resulted in an unfair trial. A special entry of an irregularity on the court record can be used on appeal  as grounds for overturning the men's convictions. The 20 Boeremag accused were convicted last year on a charge of high treason  resulting from a rightwing coup plot in the late 1990s and early 2000s to violently overthrow the African National Congress-led government. Brothers Kobus, Wilhelm and Johan Pretorius, Herman van Rooyen and Rudi Gouws -- who made up the Boeremag's bomb squad -- were also convicted of murdering Soweto mother Claudia Mokone with a home-made bomb and of trying to murder former president Nelson Mandela. They were responsible for a series of explosions in Soweto, at Grand Central  Airport in Midrand and at a bridge in Port Edward, in KwaZulu-Natal. They also tried to blow up a Buddhist temple in Bronkhorstspruit, Gauteng. During their trial, Pretorius and his brothers unsuccessfully applied to be declared prisoners of war.  Retired crime intelligence officer Captain Deon Loots testified earlier this  year that the unit had encouraged rightwingers to become more militant, and had  \"orchestrated\" the coup plot. He also testified that his former wife and fellow intelligence officer Miranda Loots had shown him footage of the accused talking to their lawyers on screens in the \"war room\" at crime intelligence. Loots used to be the handler of one of the State's main witnesses in the trial, JC Smit, before he retired in 2000. Prinsloo argued that the State reached an agreement with the accused in October 2004 that there would be no joint intercom system at the C-Max section to which they were moved. They found out only years later that there was such a system at C-Max, which  allowed Crime Intelligence to listen in on all of their conversations and consultations with their lawyers. Prinsloo said it also emerged in evidence last month that there were intercom systems in the court cells, controlled from a central office, which allowed Crime Intelligence to listen in on the accused's consultations. \"Crime Intelligence could listen to everything and tape it without anyone being the wiser,\" he said. He asked the court to make a special entry that an unknown person had obtained information from one of the accused's computers without his permission  in September 2011. Prinsloo conceded that Loots had made mistakes when he testified, but said they were only about dates and times, and that the State's own witnesses actually supported the general gist of his allegations. Prinsloo said it was noticeable that everyone who played an important role in the case had became involved only at a late stage. Legal argument continues. Sapa \/str\/aa\/hdw\/ks\/clh","label":1}

He was responding to reports that inmates in the maximum security centre were forcibly injected with anti-psychotic medication and electro-shocked to \"subdue and control them\". Ndebele described the alleged acts as inhumane. \"The department views these allegations... in a very serious light. We will leave no stone unturned in this investigation,\" he said in a statement. The probe would be led by Gauteng regional commissioner Zacharia Modise, who  had been managing the prison since October 9. The department took over management of the formerly privately-run prison outside Bloemfontein. It said that private security company G4S had lost control of the facility. One of the main reasons for the intervention, it said, was a concern for the  safety of inmates and staff. G4S had dismissed 330 staff affiliated to the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union after they refused to return to work at the prison following a strike. During the strike the facility, which houses nearly 2000 inmates, was run with limited staff.

Acting NPA Regional spokesperson, Sibulele Boyi said that Omotoso had made an application to the department to have his prohibited citizenship declaration lifted. . Boyi said the application was refused. After Judge Irma Schoeman dismissed an application by the defence to compel the State to provide further particulars pertaining to the charge sheet, an official from the department accompanied by Hawks investigator Peter Plaatjies, served Omotoso with papers to sign. Omotoso was reluctant to sign the papers at first and asked for his lawyer Peter Daubermann. Congregants from the Jesus Dominion International (JDI) church were also seen encouraging Omotoso not to sign the papers. The pastor eventually signed the papers after the official informed him that his lawyer was not involved in the matter. This means that Omotoso, who faces 63 main charges, including human trafficking, rape and sexual assault, is in the country illegally, according to the department of home affairs. At his first bail application in 2017, the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court denied Omotoso bail raising issues that the pastor was a Nigerian national and held two current Nigerian passports. The court found that he did not have any fixed assets in South Africa, although he did own six vehicles, each to the value of over half a million rand. It further emerged that he had been living in the country \"illegally\" after it was discovered that at least one of his permits was \"issued fraudulently\", an immigration officer testified at the time. Senior immigration officer Ivan Klaasen said that he had discovered that Omotoso had six passports, and not four, as the court was previously told. During May 2000, a request for eight permits, including a temporary residence permit, was made - all of which were issued the same day, Klaasen said at the time. A permit issued by a former home affairs official in Port Elizabeth was fraudulent, making the televangelist eligible for deportation. At the the time the court found that the pastor's means of travel documentation were questionable because according to Klaasen, the televangelist was in possession of a fraudulent permit. Meanwhile, in dismissing an earlier application to compel the State to provide further particulars pertaining to the charge sheet, Schoeman described Daubermann as \"deliberately obtuse\". Daubermann wanted the State to provide the times, dates and places of the alleged offences. However, Schoeman in her ruling on Thursday said that the State could not be expected to provide particulars that it did not have. She added that the charges were reasonably sufficient in nature. Schoeman highlighted that the further particulars provided previously, amplified by the summary of the substantial facts in the indictment, put all three accused in a position to adequately prepare a defence. Omotoso's co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, are accused of recruiting girls from all over the country for purposes of sexual exploitation. Omotoso was arrested on April 20, 2017, by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, at the Port Elizabeth Airport. He has been denied bail on two occasions as he was deemed a flight risk. The women were arrested in November 2017 and are out on bail of R2,000. The case was postponed until Friday. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Catherine Rice","label":0}

The department of prisons is being sued by inmates for almost $100,000 (70,000 euros, \u00a360,000) for abuses alleged to have occurred in 2005, while they  were serving time at St Albans Maximum Security Prison, near the city of Port Elizabeth. According to court documents, routine mistreatment -- which included electric shocks -- started after a senior official, Babini Nqakula, was stabbed  to death inside the prison. The prisoners were suspected of killing Nqakula, a relative of the former safety and security minister Charles Nqakula. Some of the 231 inmates bringing the case claim to have been forced by guards to strip naked and lie on the floor in a human chain, with their noses touching the anus of the inmate in front. Ahmed Patel, one of four prisoners called to testify in court, said that he had to clean blood and faeces strewn all over the maximum security section after a round of beatings during a lockdown. \"The inmates were crying like pigs,\" he said. \"The treatment was so inhuman. I saw warders' uniforms covered in blood, and  they were drunk, hitting the shit out of prisoners.\" Inmates claim they were mistreated in a \"revenge\" attack by prison officials, and complain that disciplinary charges against the guards involved were withdrawn. They also claim they were denied medical treatment after suffering injuries. Abuse of prisoners is rampant in South Africa's notoriously over crowded prisons. In July, the government passed the Prevention and Combating of Torture of Prison Act, making torture a crime. \"What we have in the High Court now is a test case of four inmates,\" said their lawyer Oswald Egon. \"They are claiming financial compensation for physical and psychological injury.\" The case has been dragging through the court since 2005, but is expected to end next month. Egon said he was confident that the case was going well, despite the delays. Sapa-AFP \/dm\/th","label":0}

{"id":"5dc272406c767a0017f2d3e8","url":"SAPAI-94a37788e2-48973.txt","text":"By GARY GENTILE AP Business Writer An agreement to end the 12-year partnership between independent film producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein and the Walt Disney Co. could come as early as this week, sources familiar with the talks said. Meetings are scheduled to discuss the final terms of a deal that  would see Disney keep the Miramax name and library of more than 800  films and allow the Weinsteins to put together financing for a new production company. Under the terms being discussed, Disney would make substantial payments to the Weinsteins for bonuses they are entitled to under the terms of their contract, plus compensation for interests the brothers have in current film projects, confirmed one source who talked on condition of anonymity. Details of the talks have been reported over the past several weeks by sources familiar with negotiations who have requested anonymity. Spokespeople at Miramax and Disney declined comment Monday. Disney has discussed in the past its desire to return Miramax to  its specialty film roots, producing or acquiring inexpensive movies  with large upside potential. While Miramax has given Disney past profits, a library worth billions and a lot of Oscar glory, Disney has complained about the costly ambitions of the Weinsteins. The two sides have squabbled about the studio's profitability, with Miramax saying the studio regularly returns profits to its parents, despite gambles on large budget films such as 2002's \"Gangs of New York.\" Disney says Miramax has lost money in three of the past five years. Part of the loss came from Disney's multimillion-dollar overhead charge against Miramax's revenue. Financial analysts generally shrug at the impact the Weinsteins'  leaving will have on Disney. Disney has said it intends to scale back Miramax's overall budget to the {dollar}300 million (?227.39 million) range - down from the {dollar}700 million (?530.58 million) range the studio has received in recent years. \"We surmise the revenue contribution is not insignificant, but the profit contribution is minimal due to the Weinsteins' penchant for very expensive films and paying expensive A-list salaries,\" said David Miller, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris. \"Disney would be better off without the Weinsteins because of that very reason.\" The disintegration of the relationship is more a clash of egos between the brothers, who have run the company with considerable autonomy from their base in New York, and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner, who has bristled at the Weinsteins' independence. In cutting its ties with the Weinsteins, there is also the prestige factor. Miramax has delivered Disney's only Oscars for live action movies, including six Academy Awards Sunday night for \"Finding Neverland\" and Martin Scorsese's film \"The Aviator.\" The Weinsteins' contract expires in 2009, but an option in the contract allows Disney to renegotiate the relationship this year. It was those negotiations that led to the current talks to sever ties between the brothers and Disney. It is still unclear whether the Weinsteins would remain at Disney until their option expires in September and which film projects the two companies could continue to work together on. The Weinsteins are lining up financing to form their own company, according to one source.

Perumal took the witness stand on Wednesday in the Western Cape High Court where Jason Rohde is standing trial after his wife Susan's body was found dead at the Spier Wine Estate in 2016. Rohde is accused of strangling his wife and staging her suicide. She was found hanged with an electrical cord from a hook behind the bathroom door of the hotel room they shared. On Wednesday Perumal, who conducted a second autopsy at the behest of Jason Rohde, testified that a number of points from the first autopsy which was conducted by the State were inaccurate, and also pointed out that there were errors in the calculations made at the crime scene to determine the time of death. Perumal said that one of the basic fundamentals of a forensic pathology student is to determine the exact time of death. \"Now when a student does not understand the principles, it's a very, very sad state,\" he told the court. \"Challenges in forensic pathology is making proper observations,\" said Perumal, responding to defense Advocate Graham van der Spuy who asked him to comment on perceived miscalculations at the crime scene. Van der Spuy told the court that he was seeking Perumal's comments on the apparent miscalculations of time of death as this could play a \"significant role\" as to whether Jason Rohde was guilty or not. The defence has argued that Susan Rohde hanged herself after a fight over Jason Rohde's mistress Jolene Alterskye who was also at the hotel on the night of Susan's death. The matter continues. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Lindiz van Zilla","label":0}

In a statement issued following the committee's visit to the Northern Cape province on Sunday, Abram said overflow of the Orange River had caused more damage than the rain. \"The damage includes the erosion of vineyards and livestock leaving more than 24,000 farm workers of commercial and developing farmers without work as there is no production,\" said Abram. The committee has asked the Northern Cape agriculture department to submit a  report about the damage caused by floods, while the ministry of agriculture works on an assistance plan. The ministry promised that the plan would be finalised before the end of this week. Northern Cape is one of the eight provinces covering 33 municipalities that were declared disaster areas by the department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs on January 17. The other provinces are the Free State, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, North West, Limpopo, Kwazulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape. Due to heavy rains, government was closely monitoring the rise in water levels in four of the country's largest dams. Five flood gates had been opened in the Vaal Dam, which was 99 percent full on Monday afternoon, spokeswoman Linda Page said in a statement. This brought the outflow of the dam to 600 cubic metres a second, from the 400 cubic metres reported earlier on Monday. Bloemhof Dam was currently 96 percent full, with an outflow of 200 cubic metres per second.  The outflow would be increased to 400 cubic metres by Monday afternoon and would rise to 1000 cubic metres by Tuesday morning. The Gariep Dam was 109 percent full with the outflow at 1200 cubic metres per second.  \"At the Vanderkloof Dam, the capacity is currently at 110 percent, the inflow is 1400 cubic metres per second and the outflow is 1650 cubic metres per  second,\" said Page. The department would increase the outflow of the dam to 1700 cubic metres per second. The predicted flow in the Lower Orange River was 3150 cubic metres per second. In the Free State three people drowned while crossing an overflowing bridge during the weekend. Police divers retrieved the body of one of the three men who were washed away while crossing the Kromellnboog river on horse cart. One of the men survived the incident, while police were still searching for the third man. In a separate incident in the same area on Saturday, a 60-year-old woman drowned while crossing a bridge near the Itumeleng township on Saturday. Her body was later discovered in the valley where the water leads, Free State police spokeswoman Captain Thandi Mbabo said. Authorities warned the public not to cross rivers as the \"current is too heavy for them to handle especially if they cannot swim\". Weather SA has issued a warning for more heavy rains in the province as well  as in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, North West and Limpopo provinces. Cellphone network Vodacom has donated R500,000 towards flood victims throughout the country and invited its customers to contribute towards the cause. \"The Vodacom Red Alert initiative provides a technology-based platform through which customers can donate R5, R10 or R20 towards a specific natural disaster,\" the company said in a statement. To donate R10 via the Vodacom Red Alert SMS platform, Vodacom customers could send an SMS from their cellphones with the word \"Aid\" to 38416.

Simpson has been making noise on the junior circuit since his Bridge Fund Managers Junior Series play-off win at Strand Golf Club in September last year. He backed the victory up with a tie for second on the series at Kingswood and finished the 2017 season with top five finishes in the Metropolitan Open and the PAT Finals. Picking up where he left off, he kicked off 2018 with runner-up finishes in the season-opening Nomads National Order of Merit at Royal Durban Golf Club and the Western Province Durbanville Junior. Simpson went into the Bridge Fund Managers Junior Series South Final in April following a third place finish in the Bellville Junior Open and look good to clinch the trip to the Junior North and South Championship at Pinehurst, but fellow Western Province junior Deon Germishuys chip in at the final hole to win by one stroke at King David Mowbray Golf Club. While Germishuys and North finalist Nikhil Gopal travelled to the Unites States last week, Simpson made hay in George. He carded rounds of 74, 69 and 67 to finish third in the Dimension Data Junior Open and brought that form to Mpumalanga. Having reigning Italian Under-16 champion Martin Vorster for company in the first round was the catalyst that helped Simpson to take it to the next level. \"Playing with Martin definitely made me pushed myself harder,\" said Simpson, who overcame a bogey start at the 10th with back-to-back birdies at 16 and 17. \"I didn't hit a great drive to start and I was under the trees on the left. I missed the green short and couldn't up-and-down for par. I went to the second hole not feeling great. \"I thought if I could par my way to the par fives (16 and 17), I could hopefully turn under par and I pretty much did that. I had an easy two-putt birdie at 16 and I laid up at 17, hit a decent wedge in and made my birdie.\" Simpson made the rest of his birdie haul over his last nine holes. \"I wasn't unhappy to turn one-under, because the back nine is definitely not the scoring nine,\" said Simpson, who knocked it in the hole at one, two, four, six, seven and eight. \"I made a bunch of birdies coming home. I was hitting it close and making a lot of six to eight-footers. The birdie at 17 was probably the best. I had a 20 foot down the hill from the left and I was able to drain that and I was two shots clear going down nine. \"I hit a good drive and a great second in. I was going for 29, but unfortunately my putt missed on the low side. I have to credit Martin. He encouraged me during the round and I definitely pushed harder playing with him.\" Vorster, coming off a runner-up finish in the Dimension Data Junior Open, did his best to keep pace with Simpson, but the Southern Cape golfer came up two shots shy. He had to settle for joint second alongside Kieron van Wyk from Ruimsig and Blue Valley's Alessio Graziani. Christiaan Maas from Pretoria Country Club and Benoni Lake's Grant Ferreira posted a pair of 68s to finish a further shot adrift. Yurav Premall from Glendower and Parkview Golf Club's Cole Stevens both carded three-under 69s and Marcus Taylor from Dainfern and Benoni junior Ryan van Velzen rounded out the top 10 with rounds of 70.

Elliot Manyika, acting head of the Task Force on prices, said the increase was in line with policy to \"ensure viability in the business sector,\" the official media reported. State radio said Friday businesses were now allowed a 20 percent markup on prices frozen in June and sales tax, known as VAT or value added tax, would be charged on top of the markup, effectively raising prices by 35 percent. The government has been struggling to respond to its economic crisis, with the world's highest official inflation of 7,634 percent, though independent estimates put real inflation closer to 25,000 percent. Thursday, Zimbabwe sharply devalued its currency, from 250 Zimbabwe dollars for every US{dollar}1 for most official transactions to 30,000 Zimbabwe dollars. The U.S. dollar, however, was still fetching up to 250,000-1 on the illegal market, dealers said. Prices of all goods and services were slashed by about 50 percent in  a government decree on June 26 in a bid to tame the world's highest official inflation of 7,634 percent. The decree has left shelves across the country bare of corn meal, meat, bread and other staples, with businesses arguing they were being forced to sell their products at below the cost of producing them. Essential foods and basic medicines are exempted from sales tax. The new increase was not expected to quickly restore supplies to shops. Some businesses have been forced to wind down their operations because of shortages of raw materials and gasoline blamed of shortages of hard currency in the crumbling economy. In panic buying, poultry breeders have sold out of chickens and say even if they can return to viability and obtain sufficient stock feed, also in short supply, it will take up to two months to re-establish a supply chain. Bread shortages worsened Friday. Bakers said Thursday they had used up strategic flour reserves and were down to two days supply of flour. Sapa-AP","label":0}

Nigeria has hired the Hart Group to probe the state-run Nigerian  National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the international energy giants which operate in partnership with it, presidential adviser Oby Ezekwesili said. \"This particular audit will be looking at what we have received in terms of taxes, bonuses, royalties, all kinds of income that would have come from the sector,\" she said. \"The audit will review what oil companies have paid to the government in the last five years. It will also audit what the oil companies will be declaring that they have paid,\" she added. \"This is to detect any level of possible divergence in the reporting of revenue that has been due to Nigeria,\" she explained. Nigeria's exports of around 2.5 million barrels of crude per day  make it the world's ninth largest supplier of oil, and the west African giant relies on the industry for more than 90 percent of its foreign income. Nevertheless, the country remains one of the world's poorest, with more than three-quarters of its 130-million-strong population surviving on less than one dollar per day. Ezekwesili said the audit was being undertaken under the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), a plan backed by European governments under which oil exporting governments will have to account for all revenues. \"The oil industry has been one that most Nigerians know little to nothing about in terms of the way it operates, how revenues are generated, what revenues are generated and how these revenues are accounted for,\" she said. She said the audit will expose the industry to public examination \"as its operations will no longer have any hiding place  at the end of the exercise\".  Sapa-AFP","label":0}

I am confident public funds have not been squandered in any way,\" Sheikh Ahmad said in comments published in the Al-Qabas daily. \"I will not accept any infringement on public funds. I will deal  with any one involved, whether he is a relative or not, in a way to  safeguard Kuwait's interests,\" said the minister. The minister called for patience until the results of a judicial  probe were available. On Monday, he asked the public prosecutor to look at allegations of misconduct on the part of executives at the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) and alleged exorbitant profiteering by a Kuwaiti subscontractor. The deal, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, is between KPC and private firm Al-Tanmia Commercial Marketing Co. to supply 1,500  tonnes of fuel daily to the US Army in Iraq through Halliburton's Kellog Brown and Root (KBR) unit. Kuwaiti lawmakers are pushing for their own probe into the deal,  saying the government could not be trusted to handle it alone A formal request to form a four-member committee to investigate the deal was signed by 23 of the 50-member house and submitted to Speaker Jassem al-Khorafi on Wednesday. The request said the MPs want to clear Kuwait's name of \"robbery charges\" and determine where the blame lies. The minister, in his first reaction to the lawmakers, said the public prosecutor remained the most neutral and preferred body to investigate. \"The Kuwaiti judiciary enjoys unquestionable integrity. God willing, it will be immune from internal or external pressures,\" in  conducting the investigation, he said. Veteran opposition MP and former three-time speaker Ahmad al-Saadun has spearheaded the motion which is likely to be tabled for voting on Monday. All 15 members of the Kuwaiti cabinet, all but one of whom are unelected MPs, have the right to vote on the issue. The committee would enjoy vast powers and could seek the help of  the State Audit Bureau, government and parliamentary experts and any other party it chooses and would be expected to report back to parliament within 60 days. Outspoken opposition MP Mussallam al-Barrak said Tuesday a parliamentary probe was needed because MPs do not trust senior KPC officials to provide the judicial inquiry with all the necessary documents. The MPs' eight-page request contains extensive excerpts from US media and official reports about the case, which finger Kuwait and its ruling family for allegedly overcharging US taxpayers. A draft US audit disclosed in December that the US government had been overcharged by some 61 million dollars for oil purchased through a Halliburton subcontractor in Kuwait. The request charged that Al-Tanmia was making profits of about 840,000 dollars a day from allegedly overcharging KBR and endangering Kuwait's close ties with the United States. Halliburton, formerly headed by US Vice President Dick Cheney, said last month it had repaid the government 6.3 million dollars following allegations that two employees took kickbacks in exchange  for awarding a Kuwait-based company an oil contract for US troops in Iraq.

We have a greater mission in society,\" he told reporters in Johannesburg. Makhura was speaking at the launch of the African National Congress's policy  discussion document on organisational renewal. He said the document was the product of the experience the party gathered during its 18 years in power. \"The ANC has to resist any efforts to transform it into a narrow political party whose day to day preoccupations are internal struggles... or winning elections.\" He said the party would interact with social organisations and non-governmental organisations to become more socially relevant. It would also focus on an \"eANC\" initiative that would embrace more technological methods of communication.  Makhura said the party still needed to do more to stamp out internal factionalism.  \"Factionalism runs against the unity of the organisation. If we don't educate members we can end up in a permanent disciplinary mode.\" Sport Minister Fikile Mbalula said the document set out specific methods of \"rejuvenation\" for the party, including addressing factionalism and political education for cadres. \"People who wear t-shirts glorifying another leader in the ANC must be educated. People, because it is fashion, they think it is right. To sing in a rally about somebody and put on their t-shirt is not right. It undermines the cohesion of the party.\"  He said it was better for supporters to sing about party leaders who were \"no more\".  Mbalula said the document was initially meant for internal distribution only, but the ANC felt that it was necessary to make its contents public. \"The ANC is transparent and democratic... we felt that it was important that  instead of having a Mzekezeke (a masked Kwaito artist), people with balaclavas speaking on our behalf, we will speak on behalf of the African National Congress.\"  He rejected the notion that the Polokwane elective conference in 2007 was the source of current organisational weaknesses. \"It is disingenuous to suggest that factionalism, ill-discipline and in-fighting started in the run-up to and after Polokwane,\" Mbalula said. \"We must also dismiss the subjective inclination to personalise organisation  challenges and attribute them to specific individuals who hold leadership positions.\" Mbalula said assassinated SA Communist Party leader Chris Hani would have been proud of the ANC. \"He would be proud that in 2012 we are still producing discussion documents and that we are still self-critical.\"  The document, among others released last month, will form the basis for discussion at the ANC policy conference in July.

But in July last year, South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi welcomed hundreds of National Health Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) who had joined the SA Liberated Public Sector Workers Union (Salipswu) in Potchefstroom. The report on the state of Cosatu affiliates show that the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers' Union (Ceppwawu) was not active in North West and South African Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo) had no activism in the province while the Public and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Pawusa) was only active during provincial conferences. Cosatu unions in the public sector had been under pressure following the formation of Saftu. The NUM lost members to the Association of Mineworkres and Trade Unions (Amcu) at the platinum mines in Rustenburg. In the Free State, Limusa recruited 5,000 members and lost all of them within a short space of time due to weak membership system management, the NUM in the Free State lost about 8,000 members while Samwu was not active. In the Eastern Cape, the Communication Workers Union (CWU), Liberated Metal CWU , Liberated Metalworkers Union of South Africa (Limusa), Sasbo, South African Medical Association (SAMA) and Pawusa were not active.

This was largely for financial reasons, said chief executive Sizwe Nxasana in a statement: \"automated solutions enhance revenue and reduce costs.\" Spokesman Andrew Weldrick told Sapa said staff reductions were not something to worry about because Telkom had a \"socially responsible\" approach, and actively worked to ensure that redundant  staff were re-trained and re-employed. In the last year Telkom decreased its employees by 8.5 percent, but only 3.6 percent were involuntary retrenchments, said Weldrick.  He said Telkom had created an Agency for Career Opportunities within the organisation, which helped people to find new jobs. Weldrick did not believe the former parastatal's employment strategy was contradictory to the South African government's goal of creating one million jobs in the next five years: \"This is a process that Telkom has been engaged with over a period of time, fully consultative with organised labour.\" Currently Telkom operates 149 lines per employee, and Weldrick said this was still quite low compared to other countries.

Dr John Demartini, human behavioral specialist, explains the hubric tragedy of how, at the peak of their careers and fame, so many superstars fall from grace.  As I travel the world and present my signature programme \"The Breakthrough Experience\", I help attendees realise that they have two sides that remain balanced.  I ask people, \"Would you believe if I said that you are always mean and never nice? Or that you\u2019re always nice and you\u2019re never mean? You\u2019re always up,  you\u2019re never down? You seem depressed, you never seem to be up?\" They answer \"no\" to every one of these questions.  When I ask them, \"Would you agree that you have times you are up and times when you are down, times when you are nice and times when you are mean?\" They reply, \"yes\". So inherently, innately we know that we have a balance. We have ups and downs, we can be nice and mean, kind and cruel, generous and stingy. In  fact all of our traits are paired with their opposites.  We intuitively know this. But sometimes we can be fooled into thinking either from our own experiences or from other people\u2019s perceptions that we are one-sided. And we can become proud and hide our internal shame or be shamed and  hide our internal pride.  The moment we see only one side of ourselves, we are vulnerable and nature brings us events to help us see both sides and keep them balanced. Successful high achieving individuals in many walks of life -celebrities, sports personalities, any high achiever - can be put on a pedestal because of media. And if the public and the person buys into it and assumes there\u2019s an up without  a down, a positive without a negative, a hero without a villain, the high achiever can be setting their own trap.  Our mind maintains an inherent balance, but our awareness sometimes misinterprets it and overlooks it. So the second we start to think we are greater than we are, our pride brings the fall. And the very people who built us up, the media, the fans, will be the first people to bring us down. What took maybe years or decades to build can be destroyed overnight.  It is wiser to have sustainable achievement by maintaining a balanced orientation, by not taking credit so that we get blame, by not getting proud so  that we need humility. Otherwise we are going to have to hide behind celebrity walls, live in secluded locations to prevent the world from seeing the other side that we innately know is there.  Superstardom and fame can be the very source of every living hell. The public assumes that the rich and famous have a better life. But behind the scenes there\u2019s always another side... unmet expectations, depressions due to fantasies and issues of internal self-image. So it\u2019s wiser to keep a balanced orientation and continue to serve and remain centred and humbled, and not let the outer fame have to bring the outer tragedy to get us back into balance.  If we are mildly proud, we get low priority distractions as a feedback reminder. If we are moderately proud, we get challenging circumstances. If we are severely proud, we attract tragic events to humble us. Decade by decade we see examples of this from sports personalities to celebrities, to leaders, politicians, athletes, superstars, supermodels. So as Nietzsche said, if you can own your hero and your villain, your saint and your sinner, your two sides equally, you don\u2019t need nature to have to get you back into balance. Those who can\u2019t govern themselves attract events to govern them.  Many heroes have fallen and while their hero was a gift, so was their villain equally a gift. It sets them free from having to be a one-sided person.  It sets them free from having to strive for that which is unattainable. So when  you meet somebody that you look up to, know that you\u2019re probably blind to their  downsides. Don\u2019t be fooled by one-sided people. And don\u2019t be fooled in the mirror. See both sides within yourself.  I did a study where I went through the Oxford Dictionary and I circled every  trait that a human being can have. They can be admired or despised, liked or disliked, traits of the hero or traits of the villain, and when I looked honestly and fully, I discovered that I had every one of these traits within. I  was kind at times and cruel at times, I was generous at times and stingy at times, I was open and closed, considerate and inconsiderate, honest and dishonest, sweet and bitter.  I found 4,628 traits in myself that were listed in the Oxford Dictionary. I realised nothing was missing in me, that I wasn\u2019t worth putting on a pedestal or in a pit. I was only worth putting in the heart. Don\u2019t put people on pedestals or pits. Put them in your heart. The super hero doesn\u2019t have to end up being the super villain.  www.DrDemartini.com  For media enquiries, contact Renee Schonborn on  renee@littleblackbookpr.co.za or 083 600 3121 Renee Schonborn M 083 600 3121 E renee@littleblackbookpr.co.za W www.littleblackbookpr.co.za  Ends \/avb","label":0}

The February 20 sees the East London Integrated Justice Court Centre officially launched. The centre will help in streamlining the Justice system in the Border Kei region. The centre is situated  at the East London magistrate's court and is part of the roll out of the successful model that was first launched in Port Elizabeth at the New Law Courts as part of the Integrated Justice System Project in the Eastern Cape. The Integrated Justice Court Centre consists of six distinct phases, which the awaiting trail prisoners must go through, these phases\/stages are namely; - Pre - Trial Services: This stage has still to be established at the East London centre but once its up and running the aim of this stage is to improve the administration of bail and witnesses services. - SAPS Liaison Component: Here the assigned police official registers and tracks each incoming and outgoing docket, thereby reducing mislaid dockets. - Docket Trial - Readiness: Dockets are perused thoroughly and guidance is given to Investigating Officers to enhance trial readiness so to prevent cases been dismissed unnecessary. - Awaiting Trail Prisoners Focus\/Formal Bail Application: The aim of this stage is to integrate the efforts of all the departments involved and to help facilitate the acceleration of Awaiting Trail Prisoners cases. - Reception\/Channelisation Court: This processes all cases from first appearance to channelisation for trial in the District, Regional and High Court. The statistics speak for themselves. The success of the Integrated Justice Court Centre has helped avoid costs to the value  of R9 860 758 and helped save 107 days for waiting-trial prisoners incarceration time. It costs approximately R96 per day to incarcerate a prisoner. Also the average number of cases reviewed has increased from 61 cases per month in August 2000, to an average of 99 cases per month. The number of court cases on the role has come down from 2451 in February 2002 to an average of 1839 in August to December 2003. Lastly, the average preparation of court cases in February 2002 was 123 working days and the average preparation time for the months of September to December 2003 was 95.4 days. This is a tremendous indicator of the efficiency of the Court Centre. Senior Public Prosecutor Ms Indra Goberdan, who is in charge of the running the Integrated Justice Court Centre, said \"The Integrated Justice Court Centre is a huge \"Yes\" in the strive for service delivery. As it helps with reducing awaiting trial prisoners, docket guidance, better charge sheet control. It also helps people who have forgotten their trial dates, as they now can be guided in a matter of minutes.\" Business Against Crime Eastern Cape managing director Kevin Hustler said, \"It is really exciting to see the successes that have  been achieved in the East London Integrated Justice Court Centre, and others been rolled out in the Eastern Cape. This will go a long  way in ensuring that all of the Eastern Capes residents will benefit, from an improved Criminal Justice System. With specific support of our East London Project Office by Eastern Cape business such as DaimlerChrysler, SPAR Eastern Cape, Johnson and Johnson, SA  Breweries, Volkswagen SA, KPMG, Eskom, Yarntex, Burmiesters Hardware and First National Battery, none of these successes would have been possible. To them we are most grateful.\" Advocate Pieter Du Rand the General Manager of Court Services from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development said:  \"The Department of Justice considers the Integrated Justice Centre (IJ Court Centre) project to be an important part of its Service Delivery Improvement Programme in the courts. Although the project has a relatively short history in the Department, it has a comparatively great impact on the productivity of the 45 courts where centres are functioning.

The spontaneous protests come after the country has seen a number of violent crimes directed at women and children which have made headlines in recent weeks and left the country reeling. \"I come before you with great humility, I stand before you with a deep sense of feeling.

{"id":"5dc272406c767a0017f2d502","url":"SAPAI-7ea4ff85b0-63412.txt","text":"Preliminary data showed US retailers had mixed results for the critical holiday season, with some specialty and online retailers showing a big surge, but traditional stores posting lackluster sales. A day after Christmas, some retailers were announcing strong indications for holiday sales while others were licking their wounds for the season, which can represent as much as half of profits and a large chunk of sales for many stores. The biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, said it saw a late pickup in holiday purchases, but probably not enough to boost same-store sales in December above the low end of the company's prior monthly target of between three and five percent growth. But Internet leader Amazon.com said it wrapped up its busiest holiday season ever and set a single-day record with more than 2.1 million items ordered, or 24 items per second, worldwide. On the day before Christmas, Amazon said 70,000 gift certificates were ordered. And on December 15, a record 630,000 people visited the site during one 60-minute period, the company said. Most retailers will report their December sales around January 8. But several specialty retailers said they were expecting to show  strong year-end sales. The Sharper Image, an upscale seller of electronics and other items, boosted its fourth-quarter profit forecast on the back of a strong season. \"We are very pleased by our robust holiday sales,\" said Richard Thalheimer, the company's founder, chairman and chief executive officer. \"While sales were very strong in all retail sales channels -- stores, Internet and direct marketing, including catalog and television infomercial -- our stores sales especially benefited from last minute shoppers and the December 20 beginning of Hanukkah.\" Women's clothing retailer Chico's FAS said December same-store sales are likely to meet its growth target of 18 to 21 percent. Amazon and other companies noted much higher sales of gift cards, meaning that many people won't make purchases until after the Christmas holiday. Yet since most post-holiday items are on sale -- some deeply discounted -- profit margins can be squeezed. For retailers, that means they must sell a lot more merchandise after Christmas to make up for the shortfall of full-price purchases ahead of time. The National Retail Federation had projected that holiday sales would increase 5.7 percent this year to 217.4 billion dollars, which would be the largest increase since 1999. But a week ago, the  retail group said shoppers still had 30 percent of their shopping left. A survey by the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC)  and UBS Warburg suggested 4.0 percent year-over-year sales growth for the season. The Internet was expected to show strong gains this year as a sales vehcile. A report last week by Goldman, Sachs, Harris Interactive and Nielsen NetRatings showed that online shoppers spent 2.95 billion dollars during the second week in December, an increase of 48 percent from 2002. The latest weekly report brings the total spent online excluding  travel to 13 billion this holiday season, an increase of 46 percent  over last year, the report said. Sapa-AFP","label":0}

A nationwide three-day polio vaccination campaign -- supported by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, and targeting 5 million children -- was successfully launched on Sunday, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarrric said at a news briefing here. \"Health partners are prepared to deploy additional medical teams and supplies, including supplies for over 160,000 people in Taizz, Marib, and Al Jawf governorates, should the cessation hold,\" he said. Water and sanitation partners also plan to rehabilitate water facilities in Sa'ada, which had been damaged in airstrikes, Dujarric said. \"UN calls on all parties to provide safe, unconditional, and sustained access to people in need across Yemen,\" he added. The truce began Sunday midnight and is scheduled to last until the end of peace talks in Kuwait that are set to begin on April 18 between the warring Yemeni sides, in efforts sponsored by the United Nations to end nearly a year of deadly war. Sunday's cessation of hostilities in Yemen is the fourth cease-fire since the Saudi-led coalition began air strikes in March 2015 to support the legitimate government of Yemen's internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

SARS, in a statement, said the crackdown was part of the new focused approach, launched in December 2015, to combat non-compliance in several sectors.

The 16-minute interview shown on Hong Kong-based pro-Beijing Phoenix TV appears to be an attempt to quell growing concern over the fates of Lee and Bo, who specialized in books on sensitive political topics banned in mainland China.

The benchmark contract, Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in September, had soared 1.59 dollars to a record finish of 43.88 dollars a barrel on Friday after hitting an all-time high of 43.92 dollars. Prices eased as Chavez vowed the oil-rich country would guarantee stability on world markets, shortly after electoral authorities announced he had won the weekend's referendum with over  58 percent support. \"It seems that Chavez has... survived quite easily the referendum, so prices are coming off on the basis of that,\" said Paul Goodhew, a trader at GNI-Man Financial. With most votes counted, 58.25 percent of the electorate voted for Chavez to remain in office and 41.74 percent voted for his mandate to be revoked, said Francisco Carrasquero, president of the  National Electoral Council. But the Venezuelan opposition rejected Chavez's claimed victory,  claiming there was fraud and \"gross manipulation\" during the voting. Chavez has previously warned that an opposition victory in a referendum on his mandate to rule would lead to the privatization of the country's huge state oil firm and prompt oil workers to stage a crippling strike.

Williams had to fight to claim her place in the rerun of last summer's Wimbledon final which she won over the up-and-coming Spaniard, with the American squeezing through a Friday battle of the walking wounded over limping Dutch opponent Kiki Bertens 7-6 (9-7), 6-4. Muguruza defeated 2010 Paris finalist Samantha Stosur 6-2, 6-4. In unfavourably cold conditions - 13 degrees Celsius and perhaps only a quarter of the 15,000-capacity stadium full during the first set - defending champion Williams, who was carrying a reported adductor injury, managed to impose her game. Bertens was suffering with a calf problem which could have prevented her from even taking to the court. As usual, Williams was tight-lipped about her situation: \"I have had some issues, but it will be survival of who can do the best,\" she said of the final. \"I want to do well and I would like to win tomorrow. But Muguruza has been playing really well, with an aggressive game and going for her shots. \"I think it will be a good match, the last time we played here in France she was able to win. But I learned so much from that match\" Williams has won three of four meetings with Muguruza, with the Spaniard taking her victory in their only clay meeting in the Paris second round of 2014. The Williams effort against Bertens was patchy at best with the winner committing more than 30 unforced errors and taking four match points to advance in just under one and three quarter hours. Bertens, ranked 58th and playing at this level for the first time, broke to start the match and led through much of the opening set, but was overhauled by the 34-year-old Williams, who almost lost her 5-2 lead in the first-set tiebreaker. Williams has been trying since last year to pull level on the 22 grand slam singles titles of Steffi Graf but has failed to win her last two majors in New York and Melbourne. Bertens was the first Dutchwoman to play a grand slam semi since Betty Stove at the 1977 US Open. Muguruza said she will not be intimidated on court when she faces Williams for the title. \"I've learned how to control my emotions inside the court and outside the court. It's very important, because sometimes it's not too good to show them . \"In a tournament like this you have to be very focused. It's very long. Even longer with this kind of weather - you have to wait a lot. \"I'm very happy, I wanted to win so much against Samantha. She's such a great tennis player. I succeeded, so it's a dream come true.

After scoring 41 from 15 deliveries in the Melbourne Renegades win over the Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL on Monday night, the former West Indies captain suggested to television reporter Mel McLaughlin that the pair go out for a drink. He added, \"Don't blush,\" during an awkward pause in the interview. The comments drew heavy criticism on social media and were described by Anthony Everard, head of the BBL, as \"disrespectful and simply inappropriate.\" \"We'll certainly be talking to him (Gayle) and the Renegades about it,\" Everard said in a statement posted on Twitter. \"There's just no place in the BBL, or for that matter cricket anywhere, for that sort of behavior.\" Channel 10 head of sport David Barham was quoted by the Herald Sun newspaper as saying the network was deeply offended and was seeking an apology.

As part of the broadcasts, some players wear cameras on their caps or batting helmets and are involved in live interviews during the action. Barham told the Sun Herald that Gayle would no longer be fitted with a microphone for on-field comments.

On Tuesday, two suicide blasts hit the departures hall of Brussels' Zaventem international airport and an explosion shook a subway carriage at Maelbeek station, close to the EU institutions, killing at least 31 people and injuring over 300. \"The recent appalling attacks are a painful reminder of the threat we all face from Daesh,\" Hammond said, commenting on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee report on the UK role in the war against IS that was published earlier in the day.

The committee recommended that the UK Foreign Office focus on the immediate fight against IS, as the longer-term goal of reaching a peaceful settlement in Syria may take considerable time.

Benitez was sacked less than 24 hours after his side drew 2-2 away to one of his former club, Valencia, a result which leaves them third in the BBVA Primera Liga table, four points behind league leaders, Atletico Madrid and two behind Barcelona, who have a game in hand. Benitez is sacked after Real Madrid have qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League and won 11 of their 18 league matches, drawing four and losing three, although one of those losses was a 4-0 humiliation at home to bitter rivals Barcelona. Club President, Florentino Perez appeared publicly to support Benitez after that defeat and strongly repeated that support during a radio interview on December 17th, but now, just over 2 weeks later Benitez has gone. The former Valencia, Liverpool, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Napoli boss, who began his coaching career in the Real Madrid youth system, had been presented as a 'club man' coming back home when he was named as the replacement for Carlo Ancelotti at the start of the summer and even shed a tear at his official presentation. However, his cautious style of play failed to win over the fans or the press and it also appears his meticulous methods were not popular with some players either with rumors of bad relations with players such as James Rodriguez, Isco, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo repeatedly hitting the headlines. Real Madrid's farcical exit from the King's Cup knockout tournament for fielding an ineligible player (Denis Cheryshev) also did Benitez no favors, even though the error was not really his. Recent games saw fans boo the coach's name when it was announced in the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium and even a 10-2 win at home to Rayo Vallecano before Christmas failed to save him from criticism. Zinedine Zidane will now take over first team coaching duties, even though the Frenchman, who has been coaching the Real Madrid B-team in the third tier of Spanish football, recently commented he did not think he was ready for the challenge. Zidane's first season in charge of Real Madrid Castilla ended in failure as they failed to reach the play-offs for promotion to the second division, although this campaign they are currently second in their group.

The sale of ABN's US unit LaSalle to Bank of America for 21 billion dollars (15.2 billion euros) is a key component in plans by Barclays to  acquire ABN Amro, in what would be the largest ever takeover in the banking sector. But in early May a Dutch commercial court froze the transaction, ruling that ABN shareholders had the right to vote on the sale. That decision was then appealed to the supreme court by ABN Amro management,  which has approved the Barclays takeover. Barclays has bid 67 billion euros (90.1 billion dollars) for ABN Amro in a deal that would create the second largest eurozone bank in terms of market capitalisation. But the offer has been dramatically outgunned by an overture from a three-bank consortium headed by Royal Bank of Scotland that values ABN Amro at 71 billion euros. That offer is for all of ABN Amro, including La Salle. The Royal Bank of Scotland sees the US unit as a means of expanding its activities on the US market. Sapa-AFP","label":0}

The man, who may not be named, on Monday told the Cape High Court of taxi driver Trevor Bazil Theys's reluctance to slit the throats of the victims as ordered to do by Waterfront waiter Adam Roy Woest. Woest and Theys blamed each other for the alleged massacre at the start of the trial before judge Nathan Erasmus and two assessors. On Monday, however, the survivor told the court that Woest was \"definitely in charge\" and gave all the orders to a hesitant Theys. He added: \"Woest was the one that led ... Woest was the one that  led.\" He said the two \"walked around a lot (during the alleged robbery), they were not in a rush.\" Pleas of not guilty have been entered for both men, to nine counts of murder, one of attempted murder, one of armed robbery, one of theft of two firearms, and two charges relating to the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. The survivor said the atmosphere during the robbery was tense until Theys's promise that the victims would not be killed, but it became tense again when the two men produced knives. After describing how the victims, lying face-down, were stabbed in the back of the neck, and the knife then forced downwards towards the floor, the survivor added: \"I saw it all ... Theys cut my throat, and Woest cut Eric Otgaar's.\" Otgaar, one of the deceased, was the owner of Sizzlers. The survivor said the cut inflicted to his own throat \"wasn't bad -- the knife Theys used was not serrated\". He told the court: \"I would say Theys cut the throats of four or  five people, but he did it with hesitance, and did not want to slit  throats like Woest did.\" He repeated: \"Woest gave Theys orders, and he was in charge.\" He said the victims started screaming as the throat-slitting started, but added: \"I don't think they meant to kill us, they only  wanted to scare us.\" He said Otgaar had tried to break loose during the throat-slitting, only to be beaten to the floor again. He said Woest was visibly angry, \"probably because their lift had not arrived, and also because they did not find at Sizzlers what they had wanted\". He said Woest and Theys were at Sizzlers for three hours, and fled after the shooting. He said he lost consciousness after being shot in the left temple, and when he regained consciousness he wandered around the house before going to a nearby petrol station for help.

This would also ensure that fewer foreigners entered the country, said home affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni. The department was recently ordered to relocate a reception centre in Crown Mines, Johannesburg, after the business community went to court claiming the large presence of refugees rendered conditions intolerable for business. They claimed that refugees misbehaved, littered, defecated in public and created a traffic hazard. Apleni said this refugee centre, which accommodated 700 people, would close on June 1 and its operations would be temporarily transferred to a refugee reception centre at the Pretoria Showgrounds. \"This won't cause any of the problems faced in the previous location because our ultimate goal is to move,\" he said. The department's aim this financial year would be to identify a suitable area on the border, he said. \"We operate on budget but in the next financial year, we will be able to open it.\" The closure of the Crown Mines facility would leave only two reception areas  in Gauteng. There were other centres in Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Durban and Musina. Meanwhile, Apleni said 11 home affairs officials had been arrested in the past two weeks for allegedly facilitating illegal entry of foreigners into the country. He said some of them had been granted bail of R5000 each, but that others remained behind bars. Three immigration officers had been arrested at OR Tambo International Airport for facilitating the illegal entry and permanent stay of foreigners. A fourth person was accused of taking a R100,000 bribe from a foreigner who wanted to enter the country without the necessary yellow fever certificate. In Durban, five officials and a local priest had been arrested, while an official had been arrested in Grahamstown for allegedly registering hundreds of  fraudulent marriages involving foreigners and South Africans. Apleni said the Hawks and the department's anti-corruption unit were analysing all the marriages registered by these officials to determine the actual number of fraudulent marriages. \"The arrested of these officials... sends a positive message that the government will leave no stone unturned to ensure those involved in such criminal activities face the full might of the law,\" said Apleni.

Playing before a pro-Mexico crowd of 15,588 at Marlins Park, Mexico finally broke through in the 73rd minute on Duenas' strike. Candido Ramirez, who entered the match a minute earlier, centered a pass from the left wing to Duenas, who headed in a shot from the edges of the 6-yard box. Mexico secured the victory on Pizarro's goal in the 87th minute. Pizarro retrieved Hirving Lozano's cross from the right wing and one-timed a shot from 8 yards past Senegal goalkeeper Pape Ndiaye. Mexico improved to 3-0 since Juan Carlos Osorio took over as coach in November. Osorio used the match as a tuneup for Mexico's World Cup qualifier against Canada next month. Mexico dominated play in the first half with repeated runs on goal, but could not convert a shot past Ndiaye. Four minutes into the second half, Mexico nearly struck again when Ndiaye stopped Eduardo Herrera's header near the 6-yard box. Senegal and Mexico traded scoring opportunities during a two-minute span midway through the second half. Ibrahima Diop nearly broke the scoreless match for Senegal in the 63rd minute when he dribbled unmarked into the penalty area. But Diop's shot from 15 yards sailed wide right. In the 65th minute, Ndiaye stopped Lozano's open shot from 22 yards. Soon after the opening whistle, Mexico applied immediate pressure on the Senegal backline. Jesus Zavala and Gerardo Flores had headers off corner kicks sail above the crossbar in the 10th and 21st minutes. Lozano had another scoring opportunity in the 19th minute, when his shot from 20 yards rolled wide off the left post. Limited in its first half attacks, Senegal had the best scoring opportunity of the opening 45 minutes when Cherif Sane dribbled unmarked toward the right wing and crossed to an open Dame Gueye on the far post. Mexico goalkeeper Jesus Corona cleared Gueye's attempt from 15 yards with a sliding deflection in the 28th minute.

Ministerial representatives from the G4 group of influential trading players -- the European Union, the United States, Brazil and India --will strive to reach a common position on agriculture, industrial goods and services during the two-day meeting which starts Wednesday. \"These talks are timely and important,\" EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in Brussels ahead of the talks. \"If we fail (at these talks), Doha's prospects for this year will be lost.\"  The meeting in the Indian capital will be attended by Mandelson,  Indian Commerce Minister Kamal Nath, US trade representative Susan Schwab and Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim. \"We hope there'll be some movement (at this meeting) but it depends on how far developing countries' aspirations are fulfilled,\" an Indian government spokesman told AFP in New Delhi. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is hoping to conjure up a deal before the end of June when crucial trade negotiating powers of US President George Bush are set to expire. India's Nath has said there is \"no commitment by India on the deadline\" and factors like the expiry of Bush's Trade Promotion Authority should not dictate the pace of negotiations. If a breakthrough can be achieved by June, a conclusion to the Doha talks -- which have been called a once-in-a-generation chance to help bring millions out of poverty -- could be reached in about eight months, WTO officials say. Otherwise the Doha round, launched in the Qatari capital Doha in  2001 risks years of delay, they said. An agreement among the world's two biggest trading powers, the US and EU, and the two leading developing nations India and Brazil,  is seen as crucial to hopes of brokering a compromise among the WTO's 150 members this year. India and Brazil have emerged as leaders in the developing world's challenge to the wealthy nations to curtail generous farm subsidies as they seek to keep their own agriculture supports. None of the big players had made concrete offers on tariffs and farm subsidies, the main stumbling blocks, and India would prefer \"no deal than a bad deal,\" the Indian commerce minister said. The EU and other WTO members have called for Washington to make a new, more radical proposal on cutting farm subsidies while the EU  is being pushed for steeper reductions in farm product tariffs. \"We want real, effective reductions in huge farm subsidies by countries like the US which distort world agriculture prices,\" the Indian spokesman said. \"We must have a level playing field so the round's development mandate is fulfilled, the official said. Developing nations are being pressed to open their markets wider  to industrial goods and services and the United States is seeking fewer farm products on their \"protected\" list. But India and other developing nations says they needs their farm tariffs to protect the livelihoods of their huge farming populations. Up to 80 percent of the workforces in developing nations depend on agriculture. Mandelson said India, Brazil, the EU and the United States need to put solid offers on the table if negotiations are to succeed. \"It's the responsibility of the G4 to put the numbers on the table\" on reductions in farm support and agriculture and industrial  tariffs, he said.

A tearful Louise Scott initially sat outside the courtroom watching the four  men chat with their family, friends and lawyers. Scott, who was accompanied by an unknown friend, then entered the public gallery and sat at the back of the courtroom with her head bowed. Her fiancee, Brett Williams, was killed at a Super Rugby match in Durban last March. It is alleged that brothers Blayne and Kyle Shepard, Andries van der Merwe and Dustin van Wyk beat him to death on the outfields of Kings Park Stadium. They each face one charge of murder, three of assault with intent to commit grievous bodily harm, and one of crimen injuria. Charges against a fifth accused, Grant Cramer, were dropped because of a lack of evidence linking him to the crime. He had faced one count of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The four accused are out on bail of R5000 each. At their appearance in June 2013, prosecutor Krishen Shah said Williams allegedly had an altercation with Cramer outside the stadium on the night of March 23. Cramer had a choke-hold on Williams and he lost consciousness, Shah told the  court. Paramedics revived him, but the other four allegedly kicked and punched him in a second altercation later. Paramedics were unable to revive Williams again, and he was declared dead at  the scene. Williams and Scott, who lived in Taunton in the county of Somerset in south-west England, have a daughter. Scott flew out from England over the weekend to attend the trial. The trial is set to start later on Monday. Sapa \/js\/jk\/cls\/ar","label":0}

Matters have become more complicated with the increase of the field from 16 to 24 teams, as the two top-ranked teams from each of the groups are now also joined by the best four of the six third-placed teams in the last 16. Article 18 of the tournament rules determines the placing of the teams and which third-placed teams progress. Final placings in the groups are determined the following way if two or more teams are tied on points: a. higher number of points obtained in the matches played among the teams in question; b. superior goal difference resulting from the matches played among the teams in question; c. higher number of goals scored in the matches played among the teams in question; d. if, after having applied criteria a) to c), teams still have an equal ranking, criteria a) to c) are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria e) to h) apply: e. superior goal difference in all group matches; f. higher number of goals scored in all group matches; g. fair play conduct in the final tournament; h. position in the UEFA national team coefficient rankings A penalty shootout can also take place at the end of a final group match to determine the placings. This applies \"if two teams which have the same number of points and the same number of goals scored and conceded play their last group match against each other and are still equal at the end of that match ... provided that no other teams within the group have the same number of points on completion of all group matches.\" The third-placed teams into the last 16 are determined as follows: a. higher number of points obtained; b. superior goal difference; c. higher number of goals scored; d. fair play conduct in the final tournament e. position in the UEFA national team coefficient rankings # Notebook ## Internet links - Tournament regulations(http:\/\/dpaq.de\/tmAeF) * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Arne Richter - Editing by: John Bagratuni, Barry Whelan - Tel: +49-30-285231472; dpa aer bag bwh","label":0}

Also weighing on market sentiment is a pullback in U.S. and European refining margins, and a larger than expected build in U.S.  crude and gasoline stocks, said traders. Oil prices have steadily moved off the record highs reached early last week, when front-month crude futures in New York hit an all-time high of US{dollar}42.45 a barrel and Brent reached its highest mark in 13 1\/2 years at US{dollar}39.12 a barrel on London's International  Petroleum Exchange. At 1345 GMT on London's International Petroleum Exchange Monday,  Brent for July delivery traded at US{dollar}35.15 a barrel, down 51 cents. By region, differentials for Russian Urals in the Mediterranean were lower Monday on fears OPEC's decision to up output by 2 million barrels a day from July 1, as well as a further 500,000 barrels a day from August if it deems it necessary, will mean extra  sour crude hitting the market, said traders. As part of the OPEC announcement Thursday in Beirut, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates promised 1 million barrels a day of actual crude for June arrival. \"There's a lot of nervousness with sellers,\" said a Med crude trader. \"Buyers saw the OPEC announcement and are just waiting for prices to come lower,\" he said, according to Dow Jones Newswires. Meanwhile, the North Sea crude market was heard being talked lower Monday amid a raft of unsold end-month cargoes still available, although some traders say it's still too early to talk about an overhang in the market. A pullback in U.S. and European refining margins is also dissuading buyers from actively participating in the market, traders said. Market participants are still mulling the impact of extra barrels hitting the market in June from Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. In the West African market, Nigerian blends heard being talked lower due to plentiful supply into the U.S. Gulf delivered market, said traders. \"A lot of oil saw its way Stateside from June's loading program,  so the market's a little saturated right now,\" said a trader of West African crude. Traders said the market was also adjusting to a pullback in U.S.  gasoline prices and falling refining margins. Also adding to the bearish tone was a bigger than expected build  in U.S. gasoline and crude stocks, traders said. Still, traders said pricing levels may receive a modicum of support from news earlier that two of Nigeria's oil unions will shut down the country's crude oil production and loading from Wednesday as part of planned national strike against recent petroleum product price hikes. Elsewhere, traders said Indian Oil Corp. bought two Aug-loading VLCC Nigerian crude in a spot tender awarded late Friday. --- Adam Aljewicz is a correspondent for Dow Jones Newswires.

His legal representative Phillip Zilwa told the court in Mthatha that an order to move the graves back to Qunu was granted \"erroneously\" last week. \"This order should never have been granted in the first place,\" he said. \"Everyone has the constitutional right to be heard in court,\" Zilwa said.  He wanted the court to hear from Mandla Mandela, who is the grandson of critically ill former president Nelson Mandela, before the order was made final. \"You don't grant an order against an absent party without letting that party  know you are bringing an order against them,\" he said. David Smith, appearing for the 16 Mandela family members who brought the initial application, submitted that Mandla Mandela's behaviour had been \"reprehensible\". Mandela's eldest daughter Makaziwe Mandela, her nephew Ndaba, and niece Ndileka -- all applicants in the case -- were present during proceedings. Mandla Mandela was not present. Last week, the Mandela family was granted a court order compelling Mandla Mandela to return to Qunu the remains of Madiba's three children: his eldest son and Mandla Mandela's father, Makgato Mandela, who died in 2005; Mandela's first daughter Makaziwe, who died as an infant in 1948; and Mandela's second son Madiba Thembekile, who died in a car accident in 1969.

The report recommends that EFF leader Julius Malema, EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu, Godrich Gardee, Mpho Ramakatsa, Khanyisile Litchfield-Tshabalala, and  Mbuyiseni Ndlozi be suspended without pay for 30 days. Fellow EFF MPs Elsabe Louw, Ngwanamakwetle Mashabela, Nthako Matiase, Hlengiwe Maxon, Magdalene Moonsamy, and Andile Mngxitama, are to be suspended for a fortnight. Eight more EFF MPs were ordered to submit a verbal apology to the House. The party has indicated it will not tender any apologies for the August 21 incident in which President Jacob Zuma's question time in Parliament was disrupted when EFF MPs chanted \"pay back the money\". They were referring to Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report which stated Zuma should pay back a portion of the R246 million spent on so-called security upgrades at his private Nkandla homestead in KwaZulu-Natal. \"The EFF reiterates that it shall never apologise for asking Jacob Zuma as to when is he paying back the money,\" Ndlozi said. \"Furthermore, the EFF remains very proud of its MPs for restoring teeth to parliamentary executive oversight.\" Ndlozi said the party was confident a court would find the disciplinary process leading up to the suspensions procedurally unfair.  \"We shall approach the courts because we believe that in front of a sober judge, with no Luthuli House mandate, and an uncontrollable ambition for promotion for a ministerial job, our action will be vindicated,\" he said. \"The court will confirm that the EFF went through a kangaroo court in serious violation of principles of natural justice.\" Parliament was unable to immediately confirm when the suspension notices would be served on the affected MPs.

All eyes will be on Makaula next week Tuesday when he will hand down judgment on leave to appeal his refusal to recuse himself as well as his refusal to quash the charges against Omotoso and his alleged accomplices Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho. The defence has already indicated that it wants the matter to be heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. If the applications are not granted they plan to petition the SCA or a full bench of judges in Grahamstown. Either way, the trial will be hit by a long delay. On the quashing of charges, defence advocate Terry Price argued that another court may come to a different finding. Price said that the defence was entitled to prepare its defence but the charge sheet lacked crucial detail, such as the time, date and specific locations as to where the alleged crimes took place. Price said the charges were vague and the indictment was one of the worst he had ever seen. He added that it was impossible for Omotoso, Sulani and Sitho to plead properly and to prepare properly based on the vagueness of the charges. In terms of Makaula's refusal to recuse himself, Price said that he was not for one second saying that the court was biased or malicious. But, Price said Makaula should have recused himself based on his utterances to state witness Cheryl Zondi. Makaula earlier said the recusal application was baseless and without merit. \"A reasonable, objective, an informed person would not apprehend bias from the common courtesy shown to Zondi in wishing her well with her exams,\" Makaula had said when giving reasons for dismissing the recusal application. Makaula said it was too early for him to form an opinion as Omotoso, Sulani and Sitho still needed to put their version to the court. \"It's ridiculous in the extreme, because not a shred of accused's version has been put to me,\" Makaula said. Makaula said he was astonished by the defence's argument that he was overly sympathetic towards Zondi and her cause. \"I'm astonished by this argument, there's nothing to suggest I was consoling Ms Zondi, I don't know what's her cause..all I know is that she gave evidence of what allegedly occurred.\" But Price argued that Makaula could be perceived to be biased by the average accused person. Price said fairness and impartiality must be objectively demonstrated but observers could have perceived bias by the court. He said it had appeared that Makaula treated Zondi very \"cosily.\" \"You repeatedly asked her are you ok? Do you want to take a break? Accused are thinking, why are you so nice to her? Why are you carrying her,\" said Price. The Nigerian pastor faces 63 main charges and 34 alternative counts which include human trafficking, rape, sexual assault, racketeering and conspiracy in aiding another person to commit sexual assault. His two alleged henchwomen, Sulani and Sitho are accused of recruiting girls from all over the country for purposes of sexual exploitation. The 58-year-old televangelist allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women who were from various branches of his church to a house in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them. -African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Catherine Rice","label":0}

The 41-year-old Cox died on Thursday after she was shot and stabbed by a man named Tommy Mair by the British press. The lawmaker was then visiting her constituents in the town of Birstall, West Yorkshire. West Yorkshire Police Temporary Chief Constable Dee Collins said in a statement that her department is carrying out a a murder investigation into the Cox case with the assistance of a terrorism unit, who will bring specialist assets in support of the enquiry. \"We are aware of the speculation within the media in respect of the suspect's link to mental health services and this is a clear line of enquiry which we are pursuing,\" she said. \"We are also aware of the inference within the media of the suspect being linked to right wing extremism which is again a priority line of enquiry which will help us establish the motive for the attack,\" she added. According to local press reports, Mair, who had no permanent job, used to attend a a clinic for adults with mental health problems. Witness also said that Mair attacked Cox while shouting racist slogans. He was also found to have links with some white racist group. Cox was a parliamentarian who suported Britain to stay in the European Union in the upcoming referendum and opposed to nationalistic anti-immigration views. \"Based on information available at this time, this appears to be an isolated, but targeted attack upon Jo -- there is also no indication at this stage that anyone else was involved in the attack. However we will be investigating how the suspect came to be in possession of an unlawfully held firearm,\" Collins said. Enditem","label":1}

Police spokeswoman Senior Superintendent Martins-Engelbrecht said: \"Following a tireless search by the team, three men, all 20 years old, were arrested in Wheeler's Farm, near Finetown, Ennerdale, on the Vaal Rand in the early hours of this morning. Finetown is adjacent to Lenasia South.\" The crime was committed on Wednesday morning. Makgabo Matlala was the granddaughter of Transvaal Judge President Bernard Ngoepe. Martins-Engelbrecht said the first suspect, who is also wanted in connection with an armed robbery at De Deurm south of Johannesburg, in 1993, was arrested at 3am, in a shack. His alleged  accomplices were arrested at 5.15am at a nearby shack. Detectives found two cellular phones in their possession. These phones had been stolen from the Matlalas' house. All three suspects are being charged with murder, rape and robbery. They are expected to appear in the Vereeniging Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.

{"id":"5dc272406c767a0017f2d786","url":"SAPAI-19a10af196-95325.txt","text":"Tension was mounting Wednesday in the city of Warri as soldiers hunted for a heavily armed militia which has attacked oil facilities in southern Nigeria and kidnapped four foreign workers. Boat crews and human rights activists said military forces had deployed in strength on the waterways of the Niger Delta, prompting  fears that a bloody crackdown may spark a broader wave of violence in the restive region. The army on Wednesday confirmed the loss of five soldiers killed  and nine missing after militants attacked an oil flowstation belonging to Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell in southern Nigeria on Sunday. \"I can confirm that we lost five men while nine are still missing. We cannot presume those missing are dead until their corpses have been found,\" Colonel Mohammed Yussuf told AFP. He said the militants opened fire on the soldiers when they attacked the Benisede flow station while the soldiers retaliated, killing \"a large number of them.\" Nigeria is the world's sixth biggest oil exporter, producing 2.6  million barrels per day, and the delta crisis has global economic implications, pushing up crude prices and depressing stocks around the world. Oil prices climbed further Wednesday, London dealers said. New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in February, gained 50 cents to 66.81 dollars per barrel in electronic dealing. The contract had jumped 2.39 dollars on Tuesday to close at 66.31 dollars per barrel -- the highest finish since September 29 -- after touching an intra-day high of 66.91 dollars. In London on Wednesday, the price of Brent North Sea crude for March delivery rose 38 cents to 65.28 dollars per barrel. It earlier hit 65.52 dollars per barrel -- the highest level since September 22. Shell, thus far the main target of militia attacks, has shut down production of 211,000 barrels per day in the western delta region. In Warri, however, the more immediate concern is over the prospect of further violence and for the safety of the oil worker hostages -- an American, a Briton, a Bulgarian and a Honduran -- who have been missing for a week. Joseph Evah, leader of the Izon (Ijaw) Monitoring Group, an ethnic rights association, said army and naval patrols were preventing access to the creeks of the western delta swamps between  Warri and Bayelsa State. \"Soldiers are now moving en masse into the Niger Delta. We have been trying to persuade them to let us have access to the riverine areas, to see what is happening,\" he said, as military helicopters flew over the city. Warri residents fear the latest surge in violence could lead to a return to the dark days of 2003, when clashes between soldiers and rival ethnic gangs in and around the city left hundreds dead and thousands homeless. \"This dispute should be sorted out by dialogue, not by fighting.  Things have been better here, but there are still no jobs. So many of the expatriates and their oil companies have left,\" said Ijaw boatman Henry Imhanlenjaye. The latest violence has caused shock even in the delta. On Sunday Victor Ejuk, who works for a catering company contracted to Shell, was sleeping in the workers' camp at Shell's Benisede flowstation on the Bomadi creek when he was woken by gunfire. \"We came running, there was shooting everywhere, the military's houseboat was in flames. The militant youths came into the place, shooting, killing a lot of people, army and civilians,\" he told AFP  in Warri. Ejuk and his surviving colleagues ran into the jungle or dived into the river and hid out until sunrise. They were later evacuated, along with at least ten seriously injured colleagues, to  Warri. On Tuesday, President Olusegun Obasanjo met top-ranking security  chiefs and the delta's political leaders, later announcing that a team had been set up to secure the release of the hostages. But the group which claimed responsibility for the attacks, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, has vowed to continue until its demands are met and threatened to \"destroy Nigeria's ability to export oil\". MEND has demanded the release of Ijaw leader","label":1}

But while consumer inflation minus mortgage costs (CPIX) remained \"comfortably\" within the Bank's target range of three to six percent, some concerning factors necessitated \"continued vigilance in the application of a counter-inflationary policy\", the  report says. These included high and volatile international crude oil prices,  exchange rate uncertainty, pay settlements and administered price increases above the inflation target, and fairly high rates of loan  financing coupled with continued buoyancy in domestic demand. SARB governor Tito Mboweni said increased retail sales, record vehicle sales and rising house prices, reflected in higher money supply and credit extension, contributed to a widening current account deficit. \"There was, on balance, little evidence that this was impacting negatively on inflation,\" he said in a prepared address to the Bank's 85th ordinary general meeting of shareholders. The current account deficit was sustainable through capital inflows. Despite risks to inflation, the decision to drop the repo rate, at which the SARB lends money to commercial banks, by 50 basis points in April, was justified, Mboweni said. The decision was interpreted by some as a change in the objective of the Bank. \"It must, however, be emphasised that changes in the exchange rate are important in the inflation process  in South Africa,\" he said. \"The reduction in the repurchase rate was... not a result of a focus on the strong rand, but on the favourable inflation outlook.\" Mboweni stressed that the consolidation of inflation at lower levels and with less variability was important for the country's economic development. It has enhanced macro-economic stability and contributed to strong growth. The central bank had achieved considerable success in pursuit of  its objectives in the past year, the governor said. Among these were sustained capital inflows allowing for the continued build-up of official foreign reserves. This, in turn, had  contributed to increased exchange rate stability. The Bank's balance sheet had increased by \"a significant margin\"  during the 2004\/05 financial year. SARB general manager Monde Mnyande told reporters there were no signs of the economic recovery coming to an end. \"The only blemish on this picture is a paucity of jobs in the formal sector -- but even here there were some improvements,\" he said. About 220,000 formal sector jobs were created between June 2003 and March 2005, but a pick-up has not been sustained since the last  quarter of last year. On the positive side, economic growth was buoyed by the services  sector, increased mining and manufacturing output, and growth in the construction industry. Labour productivity increased, and household income was boosted. The real estate market remained strong, but the rate of price increases was tapering off as the chances of further steep drops in  mortgage interest costs waned. Mboweni said he was not overly concerned about high levels of household debt, currently constituting about 61 percent of disposable income. \"It is high, but it is not a disaster,\" he said -- urging borrowers to settle their debts while interest rates were low. \"One cannot bank on interest rates being too low all the time.\" The report states that an annualised economic growth rate of 3.5  percent had to be realised in the second half of 2005 in order to achieve a figure of four percent","label":0}

In a joint communiqu? at end of the sixth meeting of the South Africa -United Kingdom Bilateral Forum the two countries welcomed the continuing increase in trade between the two countries. Bilateral trade reached 6.28 billion pound sterling in 2003, the  statement said, and the UK remained the largest foreign investor in  South Africa. Moreover, over 200 South African companies had established themselves in the UK. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said during its EU Presidency his country would try to increase EU support for the African Union and Pan African Parliament. After an \"extensive exchange of views on multilateral trade issues\" the two parties agreed that global trade negotiations were vital to the growth of the world economy, and in the interest of all countries. They also noted an agricultural agreement providing greater market access for developing countries, and less \"trade distorting support\" was essential for the economic development of African countries, as well as the credibility of the World Trade Organisation. Thirteen ministers participated in the talks. Straw delivered a keynote speech at the Nelson Mandela Gateway Centre, and the British delegation visited Langa township, Khayelitsha and Robben Island. There was general agreement on matters of foreign interest, and the UK expressed its support for South Africa's peace-keeping activities in Africa. South Africa, in turn, applauded the UK for its increased spending in developmental assistance in Africa. Regarding Zimbabwe, the ministers acknowledged the importance of  the forthcoming elections. They agreed that no lasting solution would be found unless it came from the people of Zimbabwe themselves. Health Minister Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and Minister for Health, John Hutton, said a co-operative agreement between the countries was already bearing fruit.  Hutton agreed to work to address the impact of migration of South African health care professionals to the country. Both countries supported the development of an effective defence  force in the countries, while deploring the misuse of force in international and regional conflicts. Internationally the UK and South Africa would continue to co-operate in combating terrorism, resolving conflicts, and eradicating poverty and underdevelopment. The next meeting will take place in the UK in 2005. Sapa","label":0}

The State proposed that 10 days, from November 18 to 29, had been secured for the trial, in which Malema is accused of making nearly R4 million from corrupt activities.  He is out on bail of R10,000 and faces charges of fraud, corruption, money-laundering, and racketeering. His co-accused are his business associates Kagisho Dichabe, Lesiba Gwangwa, Helen Moreroa, and Makgetsi Manthata, who are out on bail of R40,000 each. Magistrate Mohamed Shaik has yet to rule on the suggested trial dates, and the defence team indicated that it would object to the dates because it was not  consulted.  On Friday morning, Malema's counsel accused the State of employing delaying tactics. \"The State is playing with time, they are wasting our time,\" Tumi Mokoena, representing Malema, told the court.  The State alleges Malema and the others misrepresented themselves to the Limpopo roads and transport department, leading to a R52m contract being awarded to On-Point Engineering. According to court papers, Malema had business ties with Gwangwa, a director  of On-Point Engineering. Malema's Ratanang Family Trust was an indirect shareholder in On-Point. The department paid the company R43m. According to the charge sheet, Malema substantially benefited from this payment, using it to buy a farm and a Mercedes-Benz. Malema allegedly did this knowing the money formed part of the proceeds of crime. All five have proclaimed their innocence. Earlier, the case was briefly delayed due to a technical problem with the court's recording equipment.  The matter was moved to another court room so that it could proceed.  The case continues.

Schroeder, who formally took up the new post Friday, told the Handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his administration had guaranteed a credit of one billion euros (1.2 billion dollars) for the Russian giant Gazprom's Baltic pipeline. He added that Gazprom had no plans to take the loan. \"I did not know about these proceedings,\" he said. \"But the key point is that Gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks. Thus there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two German banks.\" The economy ministry confirmed Saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a \"decision in principle\" on October 24 last year while waiting for a new coalition to be formed by now Chancellor Angela Merkel. Schroeder said he was only offered the supervisory board post, for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros, after he left office in November. \"I cannot see anything wrong with that,\" he said. The four-billion euro pipeline agreement was signed just 10 days  before the German general election in September, at a ceremony attended by Schroeder and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Critics in Germany blasted Schroeder's involvement in the project, particularly in light of the credit guarantee, as a \"sweetheart deal\" that muddled his personal interests with those of  the country. \"This affair stinks to high heaven,\" said Guido Westerwelle, leader of the liberal opposition Free Democratic Party, who is embroiled in a legal battle with Schroeder over his previous attacks of the Gazprom job. Schroeder said in the interview that he believed the deal would help secure Germany's long-term energy needs. \"Federal loan guarantees are a tried and tested instrument to defend the economic interests of our country,\" he said. \"That especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for German industry.\" Schroeder also fiercely defended his personal friendship with Putin when asked about concerns that the Russian state was becoming  increasingly centralized and authoritarian. \"I am among those who are still of the opinion that the Russian president assures democratic development in the country,\" he said.

With a third of the ballots counted after Wednesday's presidential and legislative elections, the long-ruling Frelimo party had a thumping lead with 62 percent of the vote while Renamo trailed with about 32 percent. A Renamo spokesman said on Thursday that the party rejected the result and claimed victory, sparking fears of renewed violence in the resource-rich but impoverished southern African country. Dhlakama, breaking his silence for the first time since the election, said that while the vote was not free and fair the party wanted to negotiate a resolution with the government for the sake of democracy. Renamo, which waged a 16-year war against Frelimo before signing a peace deal in 1992, ended a recently renewed low-level insurgency just weeks ahead of  the election. Dhlakama, who has lost every election since the end of the civil war, said \"these were the fifth elections with fraud,\" but added:\"We are investigating (to) find a solution.\" Foreign election observers have reported pre-election violence and biased media coverage, but said the vote was credible, paving the way for Frelimo's Filipe Nyusi to become the next president. Part of the deal to end the latest conflict involved disarming Renamo fighters. But that process was due to kick off only after the elections. Analysts, however, played down the threat of a return to serious violence. \"Renamo has rejected every election since the beginning,\" said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Britain's Open University and the author of a popular newsletter on Mozambican politics. \"I do not expect significant violence in the near future because they want to continue negotiating with government.\" But, he added, the actions of the new president could be critical. \"A lot will depend on what Nyusi does, because you cannot continue to marginalise a party which gets a third of the vote,\" Hanlon said. \"He has to give something significant to Dhlakama as well as money.\" Any unrest could be disastrous for a country looking forward to the benefits  of a mineral resource windfall as gas deposits are exploited.

The 30-year-old, who joined Bayern from Schalke in 2011, has penned a new five-year deal with his existing contract having been due to run out in 2019. Neuer has grown into arguably the best keeper in the world at Bayern and is the undisputed Germany number one for Euro 2016 having helped them to World Cup glory in 2014. Bayern are bidding for a treble this term and Neuer is a big factor in their continued success. The Bundesliga title is almost sewn up while they reached the German Cup final thanks to a 2-0 win over Werder Bremen on Tuesday. Next week they visit Atletico Madrid in a Champions League semi-final first leg. \"I feel very comfortable at Bayern and I am happy we have got everything sorted out,\" Neuer said in a statement. \"We are in the running for a few trophies and have a great chance to achieve a lot this year. That is our goal in the short term but also in the coming years. I look forward to the future at Bayern.\" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was gushing in his praise. \"He is the best goalkeeper in the world and we are very pleased with his performances,\" he said. \"Manuel is so dependable in goal and we are lucky that he has decided to stay and Bayern and sign a new deal.\" Jerome Boateng, Thomas Mueller, David Alaba and Javi Martinez had all previously extended their deals until 2021. # Notebook ## Note to editors - adds quotes * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Christian Kunz - Editing by: Mark Meadows - Tel: +49-30-285231472; dpa mlm kun","label":0}

Lam Kok, the 46-year-old head of the Hong Kong-based Brilliant group, had just bought a major Bordeaux vineyard in a sale accompanied by great fanfare and was surveying his new property in a helicopter piloted by the former owner when the accident happened Friday. Emergency workers pulled a still-unidentified body from inside the helicopter after finding the wreckage in the Dordogne river, said local officials. A large search operation was called off just before midnight with the helicopter's other three occupants still missing. Officials said the search would resume Saturday morning. The helicopter was flown by James Gregoire, the former owner of the Chateau de la Riviere vineyard, and was carrying the Chinese billionaire, his son and an interpreter. Lam Kok's wife pulled out of the aerial tour at the last minute, saying she was \"scared of helicopters\", said an AFP photographer at the event. Gregoire meanwhile patiently carried out his pre-flight procedures, a check-list resting  on his knees, the photographer said. The accident happened at the end of a festive day marking Thursday's sale of  the Chateau de la Riviere, one of the region's oldest estates. After a press conference, an introduction to the staff and dinner, the former owner was planning to take his buyer on a short tour of the 65-hectare (160-acre) vineyards and surrounding grounds. When they did not return after 20 minutes, employees at the vineyard contacted emergency services. A major search operation was launched using emergency helicopters, inflatable boats, rescue divers and around 100 officers on foot. Emergency workers managed to locate the wreckage in the river after police received a call from a witness who had seen the helicopter go down. In a bizarre twist of fate, a previous owner of the Chateau de la Riviere was killed in a plane crash in 2002. Gregoire bought the property, the largest in Bordeaux's Fronsac wine-producing region, the following year. Earlier Friday, the vineyard's managing director, Xavier Buffo, said during a press conference the sale marked the largest Chinese investment in Bordeaux property to date. Hong Kong-based Brilliant, which specialises in rare teas and luxury hotels in China, had said it wanted to turn the chateau into a high class tea and wine  tasting centre. The group -- whose interests range from Pu'er, a dark fermented tea from China's Yunnan region, to top-end resorts -- also planned to build a hotel near  the vineyard. Wealthy Chinese have developed a taste for the finest French wines and their  extensive buying power has been credited with pushing prices for certain vintages to record levels. In recent years they have increasingly taken to buying vineyards as well. But the value of each transaction has generally been under 10 million euros ($13.6 million). Sapa-AFP \/kd","label":0}

Amazon is accused of infringing on five IBM patents, including technologies that govern how the site recommends products to customers, serves up advertising and stores data. Some of the patents were first filed in the 1980s, including one  titled \"Ordering Items Using an Electronic Catalog.\" \"Given that time frame, these are very fundamental inventions for e-commerce and how to do it on the network,\" said John Kelly III, IBM's senior vice president for intellectual property. \"Much, if not all, of Amazon's business is built on top of this property.\" Hundreds of other companies have licensed the same patents, and IBM has tried to negotiate licensing deals with Amazon \"over a dozen times since 2002,\" Kelly said. Amazon.com - which has bought a lot of hardware from Hewlett-Packard Co. over the years but not IBM - has allegedly refused every time. A call seeking comment from Seattle-based Amazon was not immediately returned Monday. Armonk, New York-based IBM filed its two lawsuits in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas, one in Tyler and one in Lufkin. Texas has become a frequent site for patent cases because of a perception that certain districts there are more responsive to  such claims. IBM is the world's leading patent holder, spending {dollar}6 billion (?4.8 billion) a year in research and development and earning about  {dollar}1 billion (?0.8 billion) a year in royalties. Amazon's relationship with patents has been more heavily contested; the company's patent of the \"one-click\" checkout method in 1999 was famously derided as overly broad and obvious. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is re-examining that patent. IBM is not specifying the amount of damages it seeks. Kelly would not disclose how much other companies have paid to license these same patents, though he added: \"We are not unreasonable people.\" Sapa-AP","label":0}

The payment was made within three working days of receiving the signed grant agreement,\" NLB spokesman Sershan Naidoo said on Tuesday. \"The NLB is therefore concerned that there are media reports that the opera had to be cancelled because of non-payment of the grant by the NLB.\" The French news agency AFP reported on Monday that the play titled \"Madiba: The African Opera\" premiered on Friday at the State Theatre in Pretoria but was  forced to close three days later when it ran out of money to pay performers. The opera, which tells the early life of the anti-apartheid icon who died last year, was supposed to be moved from Pretoria to Mandela's childhood village and final resting place in Qunu in the Eastern Cape. It was then expected to tour South Africa before heading overseas. Unathi Mtirara, who is also Mandela's grandnephew, told AFP: \"We are still waiting for them to pay.

The original grant application for the play was R11.8m, and the NLB awarded R2.86m. Naidoo said the board was not in a position to fund the entire amount because of a limited budget. The budget for funding to welfare, sports, recreation, arts, culture, heritage, and environmental groups was R2 billion per annum, he said. \"In the last call for applications, the NLB received 14,400 applications requesting R40 billion,\" he said.

European markets edged into negative territory as dealers awaited interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.

Information Minister Michael Makuei said a total of 224 prisoners of war would be released as a key step to shore up peace and reconciliation in a country that has just begun to heal from the civil war. \"It is agreed that all prisoners of war should be released,\" Makuei told journalists after a cabinet meeting chaired by President Salva Kiir in the capital Juba. The government spokesperson did not specify when the release will take place but said the process should have started earlier this year. He said President Kiir's side will release about 59 prisoners while the Sudan People Liberation Movement-in-Opposition led by Riek Machar will free 165. All these prisoners will be handed over to their previous institutions. Earlier this month, First Vice President Machar, the former rebel leader, said prisoners of war and those \"detained politically\" should be released in order to ensure peace and stability. \"If you have peace agreement and now form a transitional government of national unity, you cannot keep your citizens as prisoners of war.

Tens of thousands have been killed in the war which has split the country along ethnic lines. Machar returned to Juba and was reconciled with Kiir late last month under a peace agreement signed by the two in August last year under UN pressure.

The company's acting chief executive, Lauriette Modipane, said rail transport in Cape was functioning at 38 percent of its usual capacity. \"Metrorail in Cape Town has increased its bus trips to 360, as an emergency measure for our rail commuters during the ongoing strike by some of our staff,\" Modipane said. \"Presently the Cape Town region is operating at 38 percent of our normal capacity. \"Twenty-one stations are presently working and the rest have been shut down as a safety precaution.\" The United Transport and Allied Trade Unions (Utatu) and the United Association of South Africa (Uasa) have rejected a 5.5 percent pay rise offered by Metrorail and are demanding a 6.5 percent increase across the board. The two bodies claim membership of 1500 and 2500 respectively. Utatu said 100 percent of the train service on major lines in Cape Town -- the southern suburbs, central and area north -- were affected. Along the branch lines to Stellenbosch and Strand an \"ineffective service\" of about 10 percent was being maintained. Modipane said Metrorail's was sticking by its wage offer. \"Our offer of 5. 5 percent wage increase for our striking staff remains on the table,\" she said. Earlier the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) Western Cape regional secretary, Tony Ehrenreich, said the strike could be resolved for about R1 million a year. \"If you did the maths it would show that the extra percentage point (salary hike workers wanted would) cost Metrorail about R1 million per annum... already the loss in production and good faith in the company can be calculated at R3.5 million over just two days,\" Ehrenreich said. \"This strike is causing huge disruptions and all because of a one percent wage increase. \"This entire crisis in rail transport must be put at the door of  Metrorail and government,\" Ehrenreich said in a statement. Cosatu's affiliate, the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union, has accepted Metrorail's offer. The Cape Town Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the  potential effect of the strike was \"so serious\" that there was a case to declare public transport an essential service that could not be disrupted by strike action. \"In one case a Woodstock factory reported that only 60 percent of its staff had turned up for work this morning (Tuesday),\" said Albert Schuitmaker, chamber director, in a statement. Schuitmaker said people who could least afford the extra cost to  pay for taxi fares were being affected, and appealed to those with cars to give workers lifts wherever possible. The chamber also asked the taxi industry not to exploit the situation by increasing fares. Metrorail spokeswoman Thandi Mlangeni said the company could not  afford the increase. \"If we accede to the 6.5 percent we will not be able to honour our obligations to upgrade Metrorail's infrastructure,\" she said. \"We will have increase ticket prices for commuters or we will have to go to the government and ask for more money. These options are clearly not viable.\" Mlangeni said reports of chaos at many train stations around the  country were exaggerated. Witwatersrand area trains were running at 93 percent, in Tshwane  they were running at 57 percent and in Durban the situation was close to normal, said Mlangeni. \"We do understand that frustrations people are experiencing. But  we are managing the strike very well,\" Mlangeni said. Utatu however, estimated that up to 70 percent of train services  in the Pretoria area had come to a halt on Tuesday morning. About 200 workers briefly protested outside the company's head office in Johannesburg on Tuesday before agreeing to meet again on Wednesday. Utatu spokesman Andre Bester said they would march to the head offices again on Wednesday and \"camp outside\" until they got a response. Bester said Metrorail had not yet responded to the memorandum handed over on Monday. Meanwhile, some workers","label":1}

Delic Murimba took his tally to three for the tournament, and the early lead on the scorers' chart, with the opener for the Young Warriors before Tatenda Tumba added a second just after halftime. Junior Nyamuziwa added the cherry on top with two more for the Zimbabweans, who showed why they will be serious contenders for the title this year after missing out on the knockout stages in the last few editions. Zimbabwe now have six points from their two games and will need just a draw in their final pool clash against Angola on Sunday to book a semifinal spot. Their haul might also be already enough to finish as the best-placed runner-up. Mozambique got their Group A campaign off to a positive start with a 1-0 victory over Central African guest nation DR Congo in the earlier game. Striker Geny Catamo scored the only goal of the game just after halftime to give the Young Mambas the victory and take them level on points with hosts Zambia at the top of the pool. Catamo fired in a stunning volley from outside the box that left DR Congo goalkeeper Nathan Mobaelua rooted to the spot. There will be four matches played on Thursday, including both Mozambique and DR Congo back in action. There are two games to be played in Group B, as hosts Zambia tackle DR Congo at the Nkana Stadium and Malawi face Mozambique at Shine Stadium. These games could go a long way to deciding the pool, with victories for Zambia and Mozambique eliminating the other two sides. Mauritius take on Eswatini in a Group B clash at the Shinde Stadium with the latter playing their first game of the competition in the three-team group.

In the beginning there was a  decline, but 2003 and 2004 showed an increase. This had become a continuous rise. Strike-related events in Marikana in August last year didn\u2019t necessarily have an impact on the rise. Forty-four people were killed during strike-related unrest at Lonmin's platinum mining operations at Marikana, near Rustenburg in North West, last year. On August 16, 2012, police shot dead 34 people, almost all striking mineworkers, while trying to disperse and disarm them. Ten people, including two police officers and two security guards, were killed in the preceding week. Levy said there had also been a rise in strike-related violence. \"The biggest concern I think everybody has is the obvious increase in violence, destruction of property... and that grossly mars the constitutional right to strike.\" Levy said labour negotiations were not being managed properly which led to strikes. Government needed to act and negotiate with unions to avoid strikes. Changes  to the Labour Relations Act were also needed to remedy the situation, Levy said. \"I want to see the return of bargaining in good faith. I think the bargaining that we are seeing now is clearly not in good faith,\" said Levy. \"Unless we see some kind of labour reform, I don\u2019t see any necessary change in our labour environment.\" As the lekgotla continued in the Sandton Convention Centre, about 20 Economic Freedom Fighters gathered outside the centre singing struggle songs with posters in hand.

Seamus Daly has spent nearly two years in prison awaiting trial for the Aug. 15, 1998, car bomb attack on a crowd of shoppers, workers and tourists. His case joins a string of failed prosecutions against the alleged Real IRA figures long blamed for the deadliest single bombing of the entire Northern Ireland conflict. Daly, 45, did serve a brief prison sentence in the Republic of Ireland after pleading guilty in 2004 to membership in the Real IRA, one of several outlawed factions all styling themselves as the \"true\" Irish Republican Army. These small, feud-prone gangs reject the cease-fire observed since 1997 by the major group, the Provisional IRA. The Real IRA planted a string of car bombs in Northern Ireland towns in 1998 in a bid to undermine support for that year's Good Friday peace accord, which sought to end a three-decade conflict that claimed 3,700 lives. Police prevented deaths in several other car bombings with swift evacuations. But on that unusually sunny Saturday in Omagh, police responding to vague telephone warnings ordered people away from the town's hilltop courthouse down Market Street \u2014 and straight to the bomb parked outside a shop selling back-to-school uniforms. Most of those slain were women and children, including a mother 9 months' pregnant with twins. At the time, public horror over the Omagh atrocity spurred an island-wide security crackdown on those IRA factions that refused to back the peace. The British and Irish prime ministers and U.S. President Bill Clinton visited the scene of destruction and vowed to isolate the extremists. But in the nearly 18 years since, those IRA factions remain active and Omagh has become a byword for justice denied. Police have testified in court that telecommunications tower records document how a cellphone allegedly used by Daly traveled across the Irish border to Omagh on the day of the attack. A witness, Denis O'Connor, who previously testified that Daly used that phone to call him from Omagh a half-hour after the blast, performed badly on the stand last week during a preliminary hearing designed to test evidence. \"He sounded not a credible witness at all, a very untruthful witness. I would not want anybody to be convicted on that evidence,\" said Michael Gallagher, who has campaigned since 1998 for the Real IRA bomb unit responsible to be brought to justice. Nobody has been successfully prosecuted for the crime. Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son Aiden died in the attack, noted that three high-profile attempts to convict alleged members of the Omagh bombing team all have failed because of weak, disputed or overturned evidence. \"It's soul-destroying,\" Gallagher told reporters outside a courthouse in the Northern Ireland town of Ballymena, where the decision to abandon Daly's prosecution was announced. Gallagher said few relatives of those slain at Omagh had come to Ballymena \"because families have given up on ever getting justice.\" Daly's lawyer, Peter Corrigan, compared prosecutors' case to \"a house of straw.\" He said O'Connor committed perjury, while police had misrepresented their evidence on mobile phones used by the attackers. In 2009, a Belfast civil jury found Daly and three other Real IRA figures responsible for the bombing and ordered them to pay 1.6 million pounds (about $2.5 million) in damages, a judgment upheld on appeal in 2013. They have refused to pay. In 2007, electrician Sean Hoey \u2014 who had faced 56 charges, including construction of the Omagh bomb's power-timer units and 29 counts of murder \u2014 was acquitted on all charges after a Northern Ireland judge rejected forensic evidence and said police witnesses had lied. Hoey had spent four years behind bars awaiting trial. In 2002, pub owner Colm Murphy was convicted of supplying the phones used by the bombers and received a 14-year prison sentence in the Republic of Ireland. His conviction was overturned on appeal eight years later after two detectives admitted they had rewritten their interrogation notes to remove conflicts in information. The Democratic Unionist Party, which represents the British Protestant majority in Northern Ireland, said the Public Prosecution Service in Belfast had let down the Omagh families once again.","label":1}

He speaks on behalf of the faction aligned with Mosiuoa Lekota after Lekota  and co-founder of Cope Mbhazima Shilowa fell out over a leadership dispute.  In a statement the members said the Cope caucus, who met on Monday in Parliament, apologised to the 1.3 million people who voted for the party in the  2009 national elections. \"Due to a series of events and trends over the past five years, we have to accept that COPE as a credible alternative has run its course,\" the statement read. \"Eighty percent of the Cope Parliamentary Caucus has not submitted their nominations for Cope's 2014 election list processes. We could not align ourselves with the poor political leadership and cannot continue to mislead South Africans about a prospect for anything better.\" The members would remain Cope Members of Parliament until midnight May 6, when their term in office end. They said they believe the ANC was the \"most effective vehicle\" to bring about change and transformation in the lives of the poor. \"In honour of the late Tata Madiba, the majority of the Cope Caucus will vote and campaign for a strong mandate for the ANC to ensure that the agenda for a better life for all South Africans will gain new momentum. \"We call on those who support us and all South African voters to vote ANC to  give new impetus to the transformation agenda and to build a united, prosperous  nation,\" the statement read. The list of names on the statement are Suzan Berend, Onel de Beer, Beryl Ferguson, Nonkhululeko Gcume, Juli Kilian, Nick Koornhof, Mampe Kotsi, Commissioner Makhubela, Lorraine Mashiane, Pakiso Mbhele, Paul Mnguni, Zola Mlenzana, Connie Mosimane, Hilda Ndude, Mlindi Nhanha, Phumelelo Ntshiqela, Sanna Plaatjies, Leonard Ramatlakane and Kennett Sinclair. However, Abrie said half of the people on the list have not renewed their membership with the party for over three years therefore they could not be chosen as Cope candidates for Parliament. He claimed the other half were called to the ANC headquarters Luthuli House and were made \"generous financial offers\". \"They milk the cow for as long as they can and then defect just before the elections. It is tacky and unprincipled.\" Abrie claimed this was the sixth or seventh time in two weeks that this same  group of people resigned. Earlier in April Shilowa said he would support the United Democratic Movement in the run up to elections. They party was formed when senior ANC members left the party when former president Thabo Mbeki was forced to step down in a power struggle with Jacob Zuma over head of the governing party. In the first election it contested in 2009, it had enough support for 30 seats in Parliament. Its presidential candidate Mvume Dandala resigned afterwards and not long after, the party split into factions over who its true president was. Lekota was a minister of defence and a chairman of the ANC and Shilowa had been a premier of Gauteng before the breakaway. Sapa \/dm\/jje","label":0}

(AP) \u2014 A grand jury on Wednesday indicted a truck driver accused of crashing into a limo van last year on the New Jersey Turnpike, injuring comedian Tracy Morgan and killing one of his comic friends. The grand jury charged Kevin Roper with first-degree aggravated manslaughter, second-degree vehicular homicide and third-degree aggravated assault in the June 2014 crash. Roper's attorney, David Glassman, was in court Tuesday arguing to have the initial charges of vehicular homicide and assault by auto thrown out because of adverse publicity surrounding Morgan's settlement of a lawsuit with Wal-Mart earlier this year. A judge tentatively set a date for early January to revisit the issue. Glassman said in an email Wednesday that the timing of the hearing would depend on how quickly he could review the grand jury transcripts. Roper, of Jonesboro, Georgia, was driving a Wal-Mart truck when the crash occurred on the New Jersey Turnpike. He was not in court Wednesday, and an arraignment will be scheduled at a later date, said a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. The crash killed comedian James McNair and seriously injured Morgan and others. Morgan, a former \"30 Rock\" and \"Saturday Night Live\" star, suffered brain trauma, broken ribs and a broken leg. Glassman said he wasn't surprised by the indictment after 18 months of negative pretrial publicity, the settlement, Wal-Mart admitting \"full responsibility before anyone walked into a courtroom\" and the prosecutor permitting the National Transportation Safety Board \"to pronounce (Roper) guilty in a public hearing.\" \"The real question is whether the Prosecutor will be surprised in the event it is dismissed, for all the reasons set forth above,\" Glassman wrote in an email. Glassman said last week that he faulted the Middlesex County prosecutor's office for not stepping in and seeking a stay in the federal lawsuit. Aggravated manslaughter carries a 10-to-30-year prison term upon conviction, while a death-by-auto charge carries a five-to-10-year prison sentence. Each assault-by-auto charge is punishable by up to 18 months in prison. An NTSB investigation concluded in August that Roper hadn't slept in the 28 hours before the crash, a finding Glassman has disputed. The report concluded Roper failed to slow down immediately before the crash despite posted warning signs on the turnpike. The board faulted Morgan and other passengers in the limo van for not wearing seat belts and for adjusting headrests, which it said contributed to the severity of their injuries when the limo was struck from behind.","label":0}

In a real sense, these peaceful, free and fair elections were a referendum about our first 10 years of freedom, and a plebiscite to decide the agenda of our second decade of liberation,\" Mbeki said. \"...The millions we represent said that by 2014 they want to see  a South Africa that has made decisive advances in the national effort to build a society of which all humanity would be proud. They said they want to see an African continent that has taken a giant step forward towards its renaissance. \"...Nothing can serve to inspire our people and all Africa to achieve these humane goals as much as would the knowledge that the 2010 Soccer World Cup would come to our shores. \"Nothing could ever serve to energise our people to work for their and Africa's upliftment than to integrate among the tasks of our second decade of democracy and the African renaissance as our successful hosting of the 2010 Soccer World Cup,\" Mbeki said. He also thanked Fifa for its decision in 2001 to grant Africa its first ever opportunity to host the event. Mbeki, as head of state, also pledged to Fifa that if granted the right to host the event, South Africa would do whatever was necessary to ensure it was a success. \"We... pledge to the Fifa executive committee... if South Africa  is granted the privilege... we will ensure that we respect the high  standards that Fifa must necessarily set as a condition for granting this privilege,\" the president said.  Bid chief executive Danny Jordaan concluded the South African presentation by seeking to assure Blatter and his executive that South Africa had the ability to host a world class World Cup.  He added that the country in the last decade had hosted 11 major  events and had in every case provided a safe and secure environment. He noted that two successive technical reports, this year's as well as that prepared for South Africa's failed bid for the 2006 derby had concluded the country was ready to hold the soccer showcase. Jordaan's team was supported by a stellar cast of South Africans  including former president FW de Klerk, Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, Sports Minister Makhenkesi Stofile, Gauteng Premier Mbhazima Shilowa and billionaire businessman and soccer club owner Patrice Motsepe. South African Hollywood beauty and Oscar winner Charlize Theron reportedly could not make the occasion, but said she was there in spirit. TSEC economist Mike Schussler said the authorities would probably spend around R3-billion in improving infrastructure in the  run-up to the games. Shilowa, in an interview shortly before the South African presentation at 5pm, said projects that would be speeded should the  country win the bid included the Gautrain to link Johannesburg International Airport to venues in Johannesburg and Pretoria. In both cities -- and elsewhere -- roads would also have to be improved and widened to ensure crowds could get to stadiums. Much of the money spent on preparations would be recouped during  and after the event. Schussler estimated the country would earn between R13- and R24-billion, with around 500,000 fa","label":0}

The children from the Eastern Cape, one of the country's poorest  provinces, will hold their discussions with Balindlela at Francis Mmeli School of Safety in East London.  Aged from 11 to 16, and hailing from a variety of social circumstances, the youngsters would debate the issues which affected their daily lives, said the United Nations Children's Fund  (Unicef). In its tenth annual State of the World's Children 2005 report, Childhood Under Threat, Unicef calls on the world to demonstrate the will to enact its promises to children. It asks individuals, families, businesses and communities to get  involved and stay involved in bettering children's lives, and use their resources to promote and protect children's rights. Nations are implored to apply a human rights-based approach to social and economic development, with special emphasis on the most vulnerable children. Unicef also voices support for the adoption of social responsibility policies, with specifically children in mind, in all  spheres of development, and increased investment in children by donors and governments. Unicef said that while the South African economy was showing higher than expected growth, many of its children still suffered deprivations caused by poverty and HIV\/Aids. The report has found these two issues the most serious threats to children's right to a childhood. They were also holding back the  development of nations. Poverty and HIV\/Aids remained the worst threat to South Africa's  children, Unicef said. However, it pointed out that the country had  made considerable advances in fulfilling children's rights since ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1995 and adopting the constitution and its provisions for the protection of children's rights . There had also been a growing recognition of the need to create a protective environment to shield children from exploitation, abuse and violence, Unicef said. Sapa","label":0}

Wits University Journalism Programme and the SA Nieman Fellowship will co-host the Narrative Journalism Conference on June  13 and 14 at the Bozzoli Hall on Wits' main campus. The conference will be opened by Wits vice chancellor Loyiso Nongxa. The annual Nieman Narrative Journalism Conference (co-hosted by the Poynter Institute and The Boston Globe) is attended by a thousand mid-career journalists from around the globe each year. The Conference offers senior reporters and editors a forum for critical thinking, debate and learning about narrative journalism. It will inaugurate a series of annual conferences seeking to hone the craft of journalism. Kramer says increasing interest in Narrative Journalism favours readers and writers. \"Editorial interest in narrative is up as news media search for remedies to widespread current business problems: declining or stagnant newspaper circulation, aging readership, and decreased minutes spent reading papers,\" says Kramer. \"Narrative is on the remedy list because it engages readers. In this age of mega-corporate media saturation, Web sites and workaholism, readers still savour stories in which people's lives and decision-making are vividly portrayed,\" he says. \"Newspapers have tried shorter, zestier pieces, colour printing,  more reader services such as listings. But narrative alone moves newspapers toward deeper coverage, toward fulfillment of the civic mission that distinguishes our worthy profession. This distinction makes narrative journalism of special interest to many editors and reporters, even as it raises questions about the skills and roles of reporters and editors who might try it out,\" says Kramer. Kramer will present two sessions - one about the history, practice and resistance to news narrative and a second on how good narrative gets reported, written and presented. The Narrative Journalism Conference aims to tackle how-to issues, and also such practical matters as space and time constraints as well. \"Almost any news story can benefit from a morsel of narrative, because sensory reports engage readers, drawing them into the pleasurable illusion of immediacy. And narrative also opens direct ways of reporting the revealing, nuanced lives of not just the prominent, but of ordinary citizens. Dull but crucial stories can be invigorated,\" says Kramer. The Narrative Journalism Conference, scheduled for June 13 - 14,  2005 at Wits University will host key international and local speakers including Kramer, author Susan E Eaton and Nieman fellows such as SABC head of Radio Pippa Green, South African National Editors Forum head Joe Thloloe, City Press editor Mathatha Tsedu and Rapport editor Tim du Plessis. Registration fee is R1 400. There is a reduced registration fee of R450 for registered students and freelance reporters. A 10% discount is offered for companies booking 10 or more participants. This conference is made possible by Total SA, Johncom, Independent Newspapers, the Mail and Guardian, Kaiser Family Foundation and the American Embassy.

Pitso Mosimane's Sundowns went into this top-versus-bottom clash brimming with confidence after back-to-back Tshwane derby wins over neighbours University of Pretoria and SuperSport United recently. The 'Team of Choice' under German-born Ernst Middendorp were looking to arrest a slide that seen them rooted at the foot end of the standings with a mere one win after 15 matches. They have been on a week's break from league commitments following the passing of Mondli Cele. The match produced a fairly lively first half with play swinging like a pendulum from end to the other. Sundowns made most of the running but Maritzburg managed a few attacking sorties without ever looking like they could crack the Brazilians' obdurate defence which has far and away the best record in the league. Sundowns' Hlompho Kekana looked good to open the scoring in the match with a 15th-minute header but his effort was kept out by the crossbar. Thirty minutes later Kekana caught Maritzburg's central defence napping as he steered a slide-rule goalmouth crosskick from Colombian Leonardo Castro into the goals, despite have to contend with two tackling attempts. Three minutes into the second half Sundowns increased their lead through Zimbabwean Khama Billiat who fired his parting shot from the edge of the penalty area (2-0). Kekana, the eventual 'Man-of-the-Match' was back on the scoresheet in the 63rd minute when he rounded off some fine approach work by his teammate, playmaker Teko Modise (3-0). There was a reward for hosts Maritzburg as they staged a fightback in the 83rd minute when Evans Rusike scored. This goal marked only the 10th conceded by the miserly Sundowns defence after 17 games (3-1). Right at the end, Maritzburg's strong finish produced a second goal through a 90th-minute strike by Kenyan Brian Onyango (3-2). Referee Shane Chuma issued several yellow cards on the night. The offenders were the Sundowns pair, Keagan Dolly (17th minute) and Tebogo Langerman (69), as well as the Maritzburg quartet Manti Mekoa (40), Kwanda Mngonyama (57), Mphakamiseni Nene (71) and Brian Onyango (87). - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The condemnations followed a statement Wednesday by the boy's father that Madonna had adopted one-year-old David Banda, who had been cared for at the Home of Hope Orphan Care Centre near Zambia since his mother Marita died from childbirth complications last year. The reported move followed other high profile adoptions by movie  star Angelina Jolie, who adopted children from Cambodia and Ethiopia, and Meg Ryan, whose adopted child hails from China. Officials for Madonna have refused to confirm or deny the reports, while Malawi government officials last week said Madonna planned an adoption but did not give the name of the child. But critics did not wait for the official word before voicing their worries. \"This smacks of celebrity-itis and I think it's more about Madonna's needs than the child's,\" Scottish parliamentarian Karen Gillon said. \"Family is important in Malawi and I think this child belongs with his relatives.\" \"This would appear to be the latest episode in the Hollywood fad  for adopting children from developing countries,\" fellow Scottish MP Michael Matheson said. \"We shouldn't underestimate the psychological damage this could cause to the children in the orphanage when they know a superstar is coming to choose a child and they know they weren't picked.\" The Malawi children's rights group Eye of the Child also voiced unease, saying in an open letter to the singer that it was concerned about whether foreign adoptions are in the best interests  of children. The organization urged her to help fund existing programmes in Malawi to help vulnerable children and praised efforts by her charity, Raising Malawi, to set up an orphan care centre.

The prepaid Visa cards, which will have a stored value of as much as 10,000 ringgit (US{dollar}2,900; ?2,260), will be targeted at low-income earners who are unable to get regular credit cards because banks don't recognize their creditworthiness, said a Tune Money statement. In Malaysia, credit cards are issued only to those who earn at least 1,500 ringgit (US{dollar}440; ?340) per month. Many others don't get  a card because they are afraid of falling into the debt trap. \"Our card addresses both problems. Since you pay upfront, there is no credit risk and hence, no minimum salary requirement,\" Tune Money Chief Executive Officer Zafrul Aziz was quoted as saying in the statement. \"And, since you pay upfront, there is no possibility  of landing yourself in debt with our card,\" he added. Tune Money says that people without a credit card - at least 70 percent of employed Malaysians - are deprived of all the cheap deals available online such as discounted tickets, holidays and hotel rooms. \"It's ironic that those who most need the savings you can get from the deals online have no access to it because they do not qualify for a credit card,\" Zafrul Aziz. \"Our card will essentially democratize the system. It will allow  all sections of society to enjoy the benefits of the buying online,\" he said. Bank Negara, the central bank, has also given Tune Money approval to allow transfer of funds overseas using the prepaid Visa  cards. The personalized card will look exactly like a credit card and be accepted at all locations that accept the Visa brand. This will differentiate it from the debit cards on the market which can only be used at a limited number of terminals, the statement said. Sapa-AP","label":0}

Mbeki added that South Africa's law enforcement capacity and legislative framework had to keep ahead of such new developments. Addressing the second national anti-corruption conference, he said the country had to continue to strengthen capacity in anti-corruption programmes and improve on the performance of the criminal justice system. \"...all of us know that those intent on committing crime will continuously seek new ways and means to beat the law enforcement system,\" he told government, business and civil society representatives. The new Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act contained additional tools to fight corruption, including the encouragement of the public to record corruption and other crimes to the police and the establishment of a register of businesses that committed corrupt acts, especially in government procurement. It remained a challenge to mobilise sources to prevent corruption and improve awareness and education programmes, said Mbeki.  Another challenge for the summit was to evaluate whether the sectoral collaboration anti-corruption model adopted for South Africa in 1999 was working as it should -- and if not, what was needed to improve it. The summit further needed to assess the efficacy of the national  anti-corruption forum, he said. \"...to be effective in its efforts to raise awareness, prevent and fight corruption, a mechanism of this nature needs to have a deliberate plan of work, with defined responsibilities and accountability arrangements,\" said Mbeki. \"As we know, corruption occurs in all sectors of society. The perpetrators, those corrupting and those corrupted are equally guilty. While we tend to concentrate on corruption of high value transactions and the dealing of the upper echelons of society, ordinary people are the most vulnerable to corruption in the processes of accessing services and infrastructure such as government grants, water, electricity, land and housing.\" This also applied to those seeking employment or workers unable to gain promotion because of corruption of their supervisors, said Mbeki. \"...we have a particular responsibility to protect the poor and the weak from the corrupt practices of those in powerful positions,\" he said. Mbeki pointed out that at times corruption was a \"handy label\" used arbitrarily by commentators, politicians, media and those who have \"one or another axe to grind\". He said the summit needed to understand why corruption levels were often measured on perceptions and why the media correctly reported on the incidents of corruption but not on steps taken to prevent and combat corruption. \"It is important to answer these and other related questions to help us deal with the real cases and causes of corruption and not perceptions. Those answers will help us the better to evaluate the progress, or lack thereof of our work in presenting and combating corruption,\" said Mbeki. Sapa","label":0}

The squad arrived at the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Monday morning. Coach Thabo Senong says he is disappointed that his side could not proceed to the next round but was proud of his boys. Amajita managed just one point from their three matches where they lost 2-1 and 2-0 to Japan and Italy respectively but were able to hold Group D log leaders Uruguay to a goalless draw. \"I am still proud of the boys and I believe it was a good experience for all of us. We played tough opponents and were in a very strong group but we learnt a lot in every match. We played well against Japan and against Uruguay, where I think we were not lucky to get a win, but we were not good against Italy,\" said Senong upon arrival in Johannesburg. \"I still believe we have a very good team and the future looks bright. The priority is to make sure these boys graduate to the U23 National Team. I also believe a few players can be fast-tracked to the Senior National Team Bafana Bafana.\" The Amajita mentor is happy about the opportunity to expose the boys to a demanding environment. \"The level was higher, the standard was tougher, the competition was very strong and we had to expose our boys to this kind of conditions. But it was not easy as they really wanted to win, they gave their all but the composure in the final third was still not there,\" added Senong. \"This was their best way to learn \u2013 to see their strengths and their weaknesses but I still believe in them. Their attitude on the field was very positive unfortunately we didn't proceed to the next round. We need to continue to improve as a nation and as a continent and close the gap between us and the other best footballing nations in the world.\" On the way forward, Senong is adamant that a lot needs to change to get the team to perform to it's maximum. \"At the moment we are proud that we are always present in CAF and international tournaments but now the next step is to ensure that we compete and go to the next round. This requires a lot of factors and one of them is to ensure that all the players get good game time at a higher level like PSL or NFD, that will help them and fast-track their development. What we learnt is that tactical maturity was lacking, our boys are not exposed to tough competition every weekend and that was the difference between us and our opponents,\" said Senong. \"Their players are playing at a higher level but we took a talented group of players with most not playing at a higher level. I am positive that more will be playing in the PSL, or moving abroad to get stiff competition from an early age \u2013 you saw how the likes of Reeve Frosler (Bidvest Wits), Grant Margeman (Ajax Cape Town) and Teboho Mokoena (Supersport United) excelled because of the kind of competition they are getting every weekend, hopefully that will happen with the rest of the squad and that will help the national team build an even stronger U23. \" In three matches, South Africa was the lowest scoring nation in Group D with just one goal to their name, having let in four. Uruguay completed the group stage without conceding, while Japan had a leaky defence where they were scored five times. Uruguay and Italy were joined by Japan, who qualified as one of the four best third-placed teams in the last 16 of the tournament. \u2013 African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The NDP Youth Brand Ambassador Programme was conceived as an intervention aimed at promoting youth entrepreneurship to boost economic growth, increase employment, and reduce poverty and inequality. The programme aims to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030. Radebe said he and the ambassadors met with the companies on September 1, to introduce the NDP Youth Brand Ambassador Programme to the business sector with the view to fostering partnerships for youth empowerment. \"Barely a week later, we received positive feedback from the corporate sector.... It has always been my fervent desire that government, business and civil society organisations work together to combat youth unemployment,\" Radebe said. \"I am pleased to say that this programme is already yielding positive results. Our presence here today is testament that my pleas for partnerships have not fallen onto deaf ears. Business is beginning to respond positively to my call for partnership. \" Liquid Telecom donated R200,000 to this initiative. This amount will be shared between two ambassadors, Mogau Sesheoshe and Nneile Nkholise. The funds will assist towards the enhancement of their businesses and boost their growth opportunities. Mogau Seshoeshe is the brains behind The Lazy Makoti, a company that empowers rural and township women to host cooking classes on local traditional cuisine and sell handcrafted, locally produced kitchen accessories. Nneile Nkholise, on the other hand, is an impact entrepreneur and founder of iMed Tech currently incubated at Innovation Hub, which is working on the application of Additive Manufacturing to produce custom-made external prosthesis. \"I am confident that these funds will give these initiatives the necessary boost to thrive in these cutthroat industries.

The lively Bond played 18 Tests, 82 One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and 20 T20 Internationals (T20Is) from 2001 to 2010. He took 87 Test, 147 ODI and 25 T20I wickets. Bond's best figures in ODIs are 6\/19 and he also produced a remarkable spell of 6\/23 in one of the games at the Cricket World Cup 2003 in South Africa. In his column on the ICC's website (www.icc.cricket.com), Bond observed that the change in fielding restrictions in the last 10 overs of a one-day international has eased the pressure on the bowlers a little, but not much overall. \"Five men outside the 30-yard circle from overs 41 through 50 is a welcome development, and I say this purely from a bowler's perspective, but for the most part, the bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket,\" he said. \"The slow bowlers specifically are resorting to a more negative line of bowling, not because they want to but because they have to. \"In an era gone by, the pattern was to tee-off in the first 15 overs, build through the middle of the innings and then launch a final onslaught. That philosophy has now gone out the window. \"Batting line-ups are coming hard even outside the PowerPlays because the field restrictions allow them to hit over the top with freedom which is why, increasingly, we have so many scores in the mid-300s. \"To stem the bleeding is really tough, which is why teams are relying on analysis more and more. \"Speaking from my experiences with Mumbai Indians, we do heaps of work on how to limit the damage, on how to get players out. \"Preparation has become a huge aspect of modern-day cricket, and the teams ought to have already done that sort of work in the lead-up to the ICC Champions Trophy. If you have not prepared yourself before the start of the tournament, the damage has already been done. \"If you look at the stronger teams in world cricket, they are the ones who have five genuine bowlers, guys that can take wickets. A majority of the top sides has, at least, one leg-spinner, an attacking spinner always on the lookout for wickets. If you can't take wickets in 50-over cricket, then you are in serious trouble. Bond commented on the limited use of the yorker and the tendency for cricket fans to assume that it should be the death bowler's weapon of choice. \"The yorker is being used differently, and bowlers are also experimenting with a range of slower balls. The yorker is not just one of the most difficult balls to bowl, the margin for error is also extremely small. Therefore, it becomes vital to use that weapon judiciously. \"You must have the ability to change the length \u2013 bowl the yorker, yes, but also use the bouncer, the slower ball, the length ball. You don't bowl the full ball to certain batsmen, you don't bang it in to certain others. All of it is very much opposition, ground, conditions and batter-dependent. \"At the end of the day, it not so much about the outcome; it is important to see how the bowlers have got their wickets at the death.\" - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The process for Parliament to remove her would have started in February, when the House reconvened. \"It has been five months since the DA requested a parliamentary inquiry into  allegations that Tshabalala lied about her qualifications. It was an unnecessarily protracted saga caused by the various delaying tactics employed by Tshabalala and her legal team.\" Davis said detectives had been assigned to investigate the perjury charges against her. The presidency confirmed on Wednesday that Zuma received and accepted her resignation as board member and chairwoman. \"The president thanks Ms Tshabalala for her contribution to the public broadcaster and wishes her all the best in her future endeavours,\" spokesman Mac Maharaj said in a statement. Deputy board chairman Prof Mbulaheni Obert Maguvhe would act as chairman until Zuma appointed a replacement. Tshabalala has been under fire for not providing proof of her qualifications, as requested by a parliamentary committee. Davis said credit was due to all the members of the communications portfolio  committee, especially the colleagues from the African National Congress. \"They pushed ahead with the parliamentary inquiry, despite the well-known connections that Ellen Tshabalala has in the upper echelons of the party,\" he said. \"Let this sordid saga be a lesson to other qualifications fraudsters inside and outside the SABC. The people of South Africa are not prepared to tolerate public officials who lie and cheat their way to the top.\" On Saturday, Maharaj said in a statement that National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete had asked Zuma to consider suspending Tshabalala following the outcome of the committee's inquiry. University of SA (Unisa) executive director for legal services Jan van Wyk told the inquiry recently that though Tshabalala had registered for her BComm degree in both 1988 and 1996, she failed to obtain the qualification.  According to Unisa records, she also registered for a diploma in labour relations in 1995. During the academic year, she passed two, failed two, and did not write two of the modules. In January 1996, she was allowed to rewrite the two she did not write the previous year. She obtained a score of 13 percent for her human resources module, and a score of 35 percent for labour relations. Unisa then wrote to Tshabalala informing her she did not qualify to redo the  course. The committee found Tshabalala guilty of two counts of misconduct earlier this month. One for stating on her CV that she had obtained the two qualifications when she applied for the job as SABC chairwoman. The other charge related to an affidavit she submitted to Parliament stating  that her qualifications had been stolen during a burglary at her home. Tshabalala accused the committee of deciding her fate before its inquiry was  completed. She said the committee had asked Zuma to suspend her prior to the decision being made. \"That says it all. Their decision was taken long ago before the inquiry,\" she told reporters in Johannesburg on December 5. She argued, through her lawyer Michael Tillney, that the committee's decision to recommend that she be removed from office was \"procedurally unfair\". Tshabalala rejected Van Wyk's testimony as \"hearsay\", saying Unisa had been having problems with its records and computer system, and they could not be trusted. She said she had tried numerous times to get a copy of her qualification from Unisa, but had failed because of its computer problems. Sapa \/dm\/th\/jk\/jje","label":0}

So far, R82 million has been transferred to the municipality and the Section 216(2) action will affect the remaining R122 million,\" spokeswoman Phumza Macanda said in a statement. The section allows for the Treasury to stop the transfer of funds to an organ of state in cases of persistent breaches of financial management prescripts and alleged mismanagement of public funds. The municipality's non-compliance dated back to the 2008\/09 financial year and included, among others, failure to submit the 2009\/10 and 2010\/11 annual financial statements, and the 2009\/10 and 2010\/11 annual reports. \"Forensic investigations conducted by KPMG during the 2010\/11 financial year  unearthed serious incidences of maladministration, flouting of procurement processes, fraud and corruption at the municipality.\" Macanda said the municipality was warned as far back as August last year to implement the findings of the KPMG report. While the municipality had made some progress a number of \"serious issues\" remained. She said the municipality had failed to submit a list of all service providers or contractors that had, over the years, been paid by the municipality for work not done or completed. It had also not submitted measures it intended taking to recover all money unlawfully paid to those service providers. The municipality had further failed to indicate how it intended repaying conditional grants that it had unlawfully used to finance its daily operations. She said eight other municipalities had failed to compile or submit their annual financial statement to the Auditor General and were at risk of Section 216(2) of the Constitution being invoked against them. Five of them were in the Northern Cape -- Renosterberg, Joe Morolong, Kai !,  Gariep, Kgatelopele and Mier, and two in Western Cape -- Kannaland and Swellendam. The last municipality was Bela-Bela in Limpopo Sapa \/mm\/hdw\/th","label":0}

On Wednesday, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that arguments made to reverse Yaroshenko's conviction lacked merit. Following the ruling, Russian Foreign Ministry's Human Rights Ombudsman Konstantin Dolgov said the decision was \"nothing but a political put-up job\" and that the case was politicized. \"I no longer believe in the integrity and legitimacy of American justice. That is why I refuse to continue litigation, appeals... After the court decides to put me away for 20 years, despite ample evidence of my innocence, torture, kidnapping, no one in the United States will go against themselves. To hope that the Supreme Court will make a lawful decision on my case is useless,\" Yaroshenko told the Russian Izvestia newspaper. The US authorities detained Yaroshenko in Liberia in 2010 after conducting a sting operation across West Africa, and transferred the Russian pilot to the United States where he was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a US court on charges of smuggling cocaine. In a March letter to Sputnik, the jailed pilot said the court ignored much evidence proving that US prosecutors and drug enforcement authorities had fabricated the case against him.","label":0}

Premier Thandi Modise is scheduled to interact with residents and visit the family of the Christiana teenager who was shot dead at a tavern on Wednesday. He was allegedly part of a mob looting shops while protests were underway in  the town. When the group arrived at a tavern, its owner fired shots at them, killing the boy and wounding two other people. Kgwele appealed for calm in the area. \"We don't want heightened racial tensions. We are appealing for calm and to allow for the law to take its course,\" he said. Last week, protests started in Boitumelong township in neighbouring Bloemhof. On Monday, residents blocked the N12 and set alight a municipal office, community hall, houses belonging to the mayor, two councillors and two officials, and several businesses. By Tuesday, the protest had spilled over to Coverdale in Christiana where a community hall was torched. Journalists were also not spared the brunt of the anger of residents. Their cars were attacked and stoned. \"At the moment residents have blocked roads in Boitumelong and we can't enter the township. There is a police nyala patrolling the streets,\" said one journalist. Police spokesman Brigadier Thulani Ngubane said police were monitoring the situation but no acts of violence were reported.

Snow was wrapping up the Japan leg of an Asian tour that will take him to China for the rest of the week. The trip comes amid ballooning American trade deficits and increased trade tensions with the two Asian export powers. While in Tokyo, Snow applauded China's step to cut the yuan's link to the U.S. dollar but said more action is needed. \"We are anxious to see the Chinese fulfill the commitment they made to allow market forces to play a larger role in setting their currency's value over time,\" Snow said during a press conference at  the U.S. Embassy. \"They've gotten on the path that allows them to do so and we'd like to see China continue on that path.\" In July, China halted its a decade-long practice of pegging the yuan's value to the U.S. dollar, choosing instead to let the yuan to trade in a restricted float against a basket of currencies of its major trading partners. At the same time, China raised the value of the yuan by 2.1 percent against the dollar. But since then, the yuan has gained only about 0.3 percent against the dollar. American manufacturers contend that the yuan is now undervalued by as much as 40 percent, making Chinese goods cheaper in the United States and American products more expensive in China. U.S. manufacturers contend that is a major reason for the huge trade gap  between the two nations. American business leaders hope Snow's visit to China will speed its currency reforms. \"We're going to continue to talk privately about these matters,\"  Snow said. \"It will be in China's interest and the interest of the global economy as well.\" U.S. President George W. Bush's administration is fielding its top economic team for Oct. 16-17 meetings in Beijing of the U.S.-China Joint Economic Commission, which serves as a regular forum for U.S. and Chinese officials to get together to discuss economic issues. Snow is leading the delegation, backed by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Snow, meanwhile, praised Japan's recent economic revival as a \"guide to other nations\" and said that reforms of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi are starting to cement a turnaround after a more than a decade of stagnation. Japan's annual economic growth was recently upgraded to 3.3 percent from an earlier estimate of 1.1 percent. The banks' bad loans are largely behind them, and land prices are rising for the first time in 15 years. Unemployment dropped to 4.1 percent in June, its lowest since 1998, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark index has rocketed to four-year highs. Meanwhile, Koizumi is fresh off a landslide election victory and promising sweeping financial reforms to further invigorate the economy. \"Japan has demonstrated that commitment to good policies produces good results,\" Snow said. Japanese and Chinese exports, however, are also fueling massive U.S. trade deficits that are increasingly a source of tension between the trans-Pacific trade partners. Japan's trade surplus with the United States swelled 12.5 percent to US{dollar}34.1 billion (euro28.4 billion) in the first six months of 2005, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. China, meanwhile, predicted last Friday that its global trade surplus could triple to US{dollar}100 billion (euro83 billion) this year, which could put added pressure on Beijing to strengthen the yuan. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached US{dollar}162 billion last year,  an all-time high with any country. In particular, Chinese textile and clothing exports have surged with the lifting of global textile quotas on Jan. 1, and the United  States and Europe have put limits on Chinese textile shipments to protect their own clothing manufacturers. The U.S. Congress has reacted to the trade gap with China with calls for more forceful action. One measure with widespread support  would impose 27.5 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports unless Beijing take","label":0}

At about 1330 GMT, the European single currency fell as low as $1.2486, touching the lowest level since late August 2012. \"The weakness in the euro is more of a strong dollar story,\" said Nick Stamenkovic, macro strategist at RIA Capital Markets. \"The dollar has appreciated against the euro and particularly the yen ... as  the Fed slowly but surely heads towards raising rates during 2015.\" Official data showed on Thursday that the US economy, the world's biggest, grew at an annualised 3.5 percent in July-September. That smashed expectations for a 3.0-percent rise.

The Kivu Brigade, deployed in the chief town of Sud-Kivu province at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, will \"be working under Chapter VII like the Ituri Brigade\", to the north, said the statement released late Thursday. Chapter VII is the part of the United Nations charter which authorises peacekeeping missions to use force if necessary to ensure the implementation of UN resolutions. UN troops in the east of the vast country, emerging for years of war, have several times been attacked by local militias. Nord-Kivu and Sud-Kivu provinces, largely controlled by former rebels who last year joined a national unity government, are the most tense and violence-prone parts of the central African nation. The latest war that ravaged the whole country at a cost of more than two and a half million lives began in 1997 and formally ended with a series of peace pacts in the past two years. But a range of armed groups have been active in the east, on the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda, for a decade. Many armed Rwandan former government troops and Hutu militias who carried out the 1994 genocide in the small neighbouring country  took refuge in what was then Zaire when rebels seized power in Kigali and halted the slaughter.

Harden, who missed his first 11 shots in a home loss to Dallas last month, was 3 of 12 in the first half before making seven of 11. That included a clinching jumper that hit the rim and backboard before bouncing on the rim a couple more times and going in for a four-point lead with 7 seconds left. The All-Star guard also had nine assists, including one to Terrence Jones for a wide-open dunk that put Houston ahead for good at 98-96 in the final minute. Deron Williams had 22 points and six assists to lead the Mavericks.

Davis scored six points in the extra period on three jumpers from beyond 12 feet. The Pelicans led by 13 with less than seven minutes left in the fourth quarter. The Cavs stormed back to take a late lead, with James scoring 21 of their last 24 points in regulation. Jrue Holiday's 3 pulled New Orleans back into a tie at 105 with 8 seconds left before James, who finished with 37 points, missed a 19-footer that could have won it.

They reclaimed city bragging rights with ease, leading by as much as 31 points. Brook Lopez scored 21 points, and Thaddeus Young had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Nets. They had won two in a row and have a lot to fix before they host the unbeaten Golden State Warriors on Sunday. Lopez beat twin brother Robin to take the opening tip, and it was soon clear that was all the Nets would be winning. The Knicks blitzed them with a season-best 42 points in the first quarter, led 65-42 at halftime and opened their first lead of 30 or more since the 2013-14 season in the third period. HAWKS 100, LAKERS 87 ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Al Horford scored 16 points, and Paul Millsap and Kent Bazemore each added 15 as the Hawks beat Los Angeles to spoil Kobe Bryant's last game in Atlanta. In the third game since announcing his retirement plans earlier this week, Bryant scored 14 points on 4-for-19 shooting. Lou Williams topped the struggling Lakers with 18 points. Bryant showed a few flashes of his once-dominant skills, holding up three fingers on each hand after hitting consecutive 3-pointers to bring the loudest cheers of the night from the capacity Philips Arena crowd midway through the third.

(AP) \u2014 A voracious and deadly wildfire in central California has burned 150 homes and the toll may rise, fire officials said Saturday. The tally rose from 80 homes as firefighters began going through neighborhoods to count houses and mobile homes incinerated by the blaze. Entire blocks were reduced to rubble, and at least 2,500 homes remained threatened. Weather conditions that drove the fire through small southern Sierra Nevada communities with terrifying speed remained a worry, with low humidity and 30-mph steady winds forecast, \"That's something we have to keep an eye on. It could spark another disaster,\" Kern County fire Engineer Anthony Romero said. About 1,100 firefighters battled the flames. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, freeing up money and resources to fight the fire and to clean up in the aftermath. The Federal Emergency Management Agency also authorized the use of funds for firefighting efforts. Since it began Thursday, the fire has swept through 35,711 acres \u2014 nearly 56 square miles \u2014 of parched brush and timber. It moved so quickly that some residents barely had time to escape \u2014 and two didn't. An elderly couple apparently were overcome by smoke as they tried to flee, county Sheriff Donny Youngblood said. Their bodies were found Friday but their names haven't been released. Everett Evans, 45, fled Thursday as the fire came down a mountain with a roar toward his South Lake mobile home. \"When you hear a freight train, it's time to leave. You could hear it, you could see it, you could smell it,\" he said. Evans said he knocked on doors to get neighbors to leave. Evans and his father, son and his son's girlfriend were in the convoy. But he has nothing left to come back to. Virtually no homes survived in his neighborhood. A reporter visiting on Saturday found only a burned flag blowing in the wind on a flagpole above the rubble of Evans' home. Evans hadn't been allowed back to the home but said he lost mementos and photos from his former marriage and years in the Marine Corps. \"That's all memories. You get to keep your life but you lose your memories,\" he said. Shiela McFarland, 67, from Mountain Mesa, left her home three days ago, taking her computer, cellphone, papers and her miniature poodle, Snuggles. At an evacuation center, she slept on a cot outdoors next to his kennel. McFarland said she didn't know whether her home survived, but she was philosophical. \"It doesn't matter if I've lost everything,\" she said Saturday. \"I've got my little dog, my kids and my grandkids. I've seen other people in worse shape.\" The fire tore through small communities of houses and mobile homes that surround the lake \u2014 actually a reservoir \u2014 and the Kern River, a popular spot for fishing and whitewater rafting. The communities are nestled in foothills of the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that runs hundreds of miles north and south through eastern California. Scorching heat and tinder-dry conditions across the West have contributed to massive wildfires in the past week that have destroyed properties and sent residents to seek shelter and hope for the best. Laura Rogers was one of those who thought she'd never see her home or her brother's home again. Instead, she was lucky to find both standing in a neighborhood of mobile homes that was devastated. \"I was sure this place was gone last night,\" Rogers said through tears Friday as she gestured at the destruction around her. \"I mean look at this, I can't believe it. It's like a scary movie.\" The downspout of her brother's home was melted on the ground, but the structure was intact. Dozens of other homes were gone, left in piles of charred sheet metal and cinderblock foundations. Scorched tricycles, air conditioners and TV dishes littered the landscape. Burned-out cars sat on tireless rims and leafless trees poked from barren, blackened dirt. ___ Jablon reported from Los Angeles.

Speaking on the sidelines of the Chamber's media briefing, Mgojo said the new laws were designed in a way that they had the potential of crippling the industry by driving investment away. \"There is no capital as we speak. People are trying to raise capital and capital is getting expensive. Our vice-president is abroad on an investor roadshow and he just called us today asking what is happening because investors are questioning him,\" Mgojo said. \"Unfortunately, the situation we find ourselves in is that because of this uncertainty, and because of the environment becoming more difficult to operate in, capital is not going to come. Mines are not going to be developed, and jobs are going to be lost.\" The Chamber of Mines rejected the 2017 Mining Charter saying it would approach the courts to stop the department of mineral resources (DMR) from implementing it. The Chamber was responding to the gazetting of the charter by Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane on Thursday morning. The Charter sets new black ownership targets for the industry. The targets included new mining rights, holders having 30 percent black ownership to be shared among employees, communities and black entrepreneurs. Mining rights holders who have complied with the previous target of 26 percent have to \"top up\" to 30 percent within 12 months. Those applying for prospecting rights would be required to have a \"minimum of 50 percent plus one black person shareholding\". These shareholders must have voting rights. Asked what was behind the department's lack of consultation, Mgojo said he was not quite sure what was happening and why the consultation process was abandoned, but only had 40 minutes to look at the Charter before it was presented to the public. Mgojo said that relationship between the Chamber and the minister was strained as there has been no communication whatsoever with the DMR in the last two months. \"All I can say is that we are very saddened by the fact that a process that in the past has proved itself to have worked where difficult issues were able to be put on the table and resolutions which everybody could fully support, in this instance did not happen,\" Mgojo said. \"We hope sense will prevail. We will try and reason with the Minister that the right process has to be taken to ensure that subsequent to consultation and negotiation resume.\" - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Neither are the latest Dan Brown novels and classic Chinese  fiction. Voracious demand for books and a crackdown on small, polluting paper  mills have caused a paper crunch in China, pushing up the price of paper by 10 percent so far this year and forcing printers to delay books and publishers to raise prices. So far the problems have been largely confined to China, but experts  say that if the trend is unchecked, publishers worldwide could find themselves paying higher costs - and consumers facing higher book prices. The Chinese paperback translation of the \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" the seventh in the series, sells for 66 yuan (US{dollar}9 or  ?6), more than twice the price of its predecessors and a slice out of disposable income that in cities still averages less than 1,200 yuan (US{dollar}165 or ?120) a month. \"This one is too expensive if you want to buy the whole series,\" sniffed 21-year-old university student Li Jie as she browsed at a central Beijing bookstore, \"especially for a student.\" China is deeply embedded in the international book market. It is the  United States' biggest offshore supplier of print products, chiefly books. Exports of paper products from China rose by 76 percent between 2005 and 2006, according to government statistics, and are projected to  rise a similar amount by the end of the decade. Like many manufacturers, publishers in the United States and Europe are turning to Chinese printers to churn out books, reducing their costs by up to 30 percent, according to Pira International, a research and consultancy firm specializing in the print and paper industries. As a result of these trends, Chinese printing companies are cutting a visible presence at world book fairs. \"The main reason is price, and the other is quality,\" said Stephanie  Chen, a sales representative for southern-China based Hengyuan Printing  Co., who attended the most recent Frankfurt book fair, a major get-together for the world's publishing industry. China will be a special guest at next year's gathering. As international and domestic demand for Chinese paper grows, the government is shutting down small paper mills to clean up the environment and force consolidation in a fragmented industry. \"The closures in China will tighten the demand\" in China and lift the price of paper worldwide, said Sandy Lu, an economist for forest products industry group RISI in Shanghai. Penguin UK, a British book publisher, spends about 60 percent of its  manufacturing budget in China, a shift that created savings of 20 percent to 50 percent three years ago when it first moved here. Those savings have provided a cushion that the company says will allow the publisher to avoid raising prices - for now. \"Inflationary pressures will bite eventually but we have huge volumes and a broad supplier base,\" Liz Allen, Penguin's production director in London, said in an email. She said cost inflation will not be \"a significant problem for some time to come.\" China is credited as the first country to invent paper, believed to have been around the 2nd century, before it was spread to the Arab world along the ancient Silk Road and then on to Europe centuries later. But the industry has relied on straw and other waste from crops to make paper, not the wood pulp used in the West. But crop and straw waste is highly polluting and not as easily recycled as wood pulp. Paper mills, most of them small, inefficient operators, accounted for 17 percent all industrial water pollution in 2005, according to the  Chinese Paper Association, an industry group. In a bid to clean up China's rivers and spur the paper-making industry to consolidate and modernize by using wood pulp, the government has closed down hundreds of mills and targeted hundreds more  for shutdown between 2006 and 2010. In March, the government closed 234  mills alone around severely polluted Dongting Lake, in central China. The restructuring is spurring heavy demand for wood pulp, nea","label":0}

La Roja - who are bidding to become the first team ever to win three straight Euros - are joint top of Group D with Croatia on three points, while Turkey have zero. However, the defending champions don't only want to win Friday, but also to improve on Monday's spirited but laboured late 1-0 defeat of the Czech Republic. \"Monday's win was a fairly good start,\" Radio Marca said. \"But now we want to see the team playing with more joy and speed, with more precision and penetration.\" Rival station Cadena COPE remarked: \"Let's hope that Spain go from acceptable to excellent in the tournament,\" as it happened in 2012 when they started out with a disappointing 1-1 against Italy but ended up caning the Azzurri 4-0 in the final. \"With the quality of the players in the squad, good football and results are bound to follow soon.\" Striker Nolito has echoed these sentiments, saying: \"I understand that not everyone is happy with the way we played the other day. \"But it is not easy being the reigning champions, playing against teams which defend in depth and leave hardly any space at all at the back...\" The Celta Vigo striker was full of praise for veteran playmaker Andres Iniesta, who set up the winning goal Monday for defender Gerard Pique. \"It's a real pleasure to play with Iniesta. I enjoy every moment I play alongside him. In 30 years, I'll be able to tell my grandchildren that I played with the great Iniesta.\" Nolito also said he was pleased that defenders Pique and Sergio Ramos seemed to have finally ended their long-running feud. \"They are both important players for us, and have been for many years now,\" he said. Veteran manager Vicente del Bosque is likely to stick by young goalkeeper David de Gea, despite the allegations concerning his involvement in an ugly sexual assault in 2012. However, one player who might be benched is midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who looked slow and unsure of himself against the Czechs. The man poised to replace Fabregas against the Turks, who lost their opener 1-0 against Croatia, is former team-mate at Barcelona Thiago. \"I want to play as many minutes as possible, we all do,\" the Bayern Munich man said. \"The competition for places in the squad is massive, because all of the players are of very high quality.\" Around 10,000 Spanish fans are expected to be in Nice Friday, hoping to see a win which will put the holders into the round of 16. # Notebook * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Duncan Shaw - Editing by: John Bagratuni - Tel: +49-30-285231472; international@dpa.com dpa ds bag","label":0}

Cyprus meanwhile launched an investigation into a list published in Greek newspapers of Cypriot politicians who allegedly had loans written off by two banks at the heart of the financial meltdown. Officials said Bank of Cyprus savers will see at least 37.5 percent of funds  over 100,000 euros ($128,000) turned into shares, but a further 22.5 percent will be held until authorities know they can satisfy the terms of the bailout. Under the first eurozone rescue package to punish savers with a so-called \"haircut\" of their money, Cyprus can only qualify for the 10-billion-euro ($13-billion) loan by finding 5.8 billion euros of its own. \"There will be a 37.5 percent haircut on deposits over 100,000 euros that will be converted into shares,\" said Marios Mavrides, a lawmaker from the conservative Disy party of President Nicos Anastasiades. \"Then 22.5 percent will be held from the account for about two or three months, but this sum might be lower if a bigger haircut is needed,\" Mavrides said. The remaining 40 percent would be held for six months to prevent the east Mediterranean island's banks being drained. Senior Bank of Cyprus official Mario Skandalis confirmed the figures, although he said they had not been finalised and a final announcement was expected by Monday. Asked whether the loss rate could be as high as 60 percent he told AFP: \"It could be a possibility but I would say it is a remote possibility.\" The size of the levies will be a further blow to both Cypriots and foreign investors -- particularly Russians -- with large sums in the island's bloated offshore banking sector. It will also alarm other struggling eurozone members who fear the \"troika\" of the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund could demand similar terms for future bailouts. Bank of Cyprus is set to absorb what is salvaged from the island's second largest lender Laiki under the deal, while the rest of it will be wound up with  the loss of thousands of jobs. A panel appointed by Anastasiades will investigate a list published by Greek  media of Cypriot politicians who allegedly had loans forgiven during the meltdown, Justice Minister Ionas Nicolaou said. The president will swear in the commission of three supreme court judges on Tuesday with a deadline of three months to report back, said Nicolaou, while a committee of lawmakers will also look at the claims. Bank of Cyprus, Laiki and third largest lender Hellenic Bank reportedly forgave millions of euros in loans over the past five years to lawmakers, companies and local authorities, newspapers in Greece said. Cypriots are meanwhile hoping authorities further ease capital controls -- the first in the eurozone's history -- which were imposed to stop a run on banks when they reopened on Thursday after a 12-day shutdown. The reopening went smoothly, and the central bank on Friday lifted all limits on domestic card payments while saying it would make daily efforts to \"refine or relax\" the curbs. Draconian controls remain in place, including a daily withdrawal limit of 300 euros and a ban on taking more than 1,000 euros in cash out of the country. Monday will be the third public holiday in a row as Greek Cypriots mark the anniversary of the launch of an armed uprising against British colonial rule in  1955. But the sense of solidarity as Cyprus faces its greatest crisis since Turkish troops occupied the north of the island in 1974 remains strong. Around 50 performers will take part in a \"concert of solidarity and hope\" in  Nicosia on Saturday night. The phone company Cyta meanwhile announced that calls from fixed lines would  be free in April while the government has said it is looking for a way to lower  the island's high electricity costs.

According to Jafta, Jabed-Ali dropped his sister-in-law and an employee at one of his businesses at Sakhele at about 8am on Saturday. \"While driving to a second business with a friend they were confronted by two armed men who forced Jabed-Ali to stop his vehicle,\" Jafta said.

He said the party's economics expert, Ken Andrew, had been co-ordinating a policy review over the past six months. \"We are perhaps guilty of failing to find enough creative ways to communicate our policies to the public. \"But we have taken steps to remedy that. Within the next week we  will be launching a campaign right across the country, the purpose of which is to communicate one of our key policy initiatives to the  people.\" On the DA's current role in South Africa, Leon said the party's aim was to build an independent, principled, non-racial alternative  to the ANC. \"Our mission is to grow our opposition into a party that can become part of an alternative government of South Africa in the foreseeable future.\" He said that although the party disagreed with some of the ANC's  policies and its approach, it did not mean the party was \"negative\"  or \"unpatriotic\". \"It means that we have convictions, and the courage of those convictions. We also have a constituency that demands bold representation in parliament, legislatures and councils.\" Leon said the DA should never become a party that criticised and  opposed without offering practical alternatives. He said DA was stronger today than it was before the defections in October -- mostly of former New National Party councillors back to the NNP -- began because the party was now united internally. \"... we have retained the support of the bulk of our constituency through it all; our main rivals in the opposition marketplace have been eliminated.

On the contrary, it seems to be equally arguable that it supports that conclusion. The letters of 31 August and 6 October, written by Shaik to Th?tard, show a marked sense of frustration on the part of Shaik at the lack of some unspecified action on the part of Thomson. For reasons already given, that was patently not for payment of a donation. With an on-going need for money for Zuma and none forthcoming as Shaik expected, it would more cogently explain the tone of those letters. By the time the second one was written, the possibility of an investigation into the corvette contracts was a live issue, made even livelier by the recommendation of the SCOPA inquiry that the investigations be continued by, inter alia, specialist investigative agencies like the NPA and the Heath Commission. This possibility became a likelihood by the time the 14th SCOPA report was ready at the end of October. All these developments, as I have said, Shaik agreed he watched and noted. That development would have brought into focus the need for someone who could thwart that recommendation, which was exactly  what the agreement of 11 March was all about. But as Thomson had not looked like performing their part, reliance on the selected protector might prove illusory. So the payment had to be made somehow and obviously by a medium that would not attract attention.  It is therefore overwhelmingly probable, in our view, that this is the reason why the first service provider agreement application was  prepared on 1 November, and it is on the pro forma agreement that was found with this in the Nkobi office that the manuscript notations are recorded which, in our view, indicate the thoughts of  the maker at the time. Those establish very cogently Shaik's perception of the purpose he intended this agreement to serve. That conclusion is reinforced by the conspicuous contradiction between his evidence of how he came to resort to the service provider agreement and the objective facts. According to the accused, he decided to resort to the service provider agreement after learning from Dr Zweli Mkhize that the R900 000 he had taken from Zuma's personal account was for Development Africa. He heard of that on 6 December 2000 and immediately arranged with Th?tard to  put such agreement in train to earn money to repay what he had taken and sending the application form received from Th?tard with the covering letter of 8 December. That cannot be true, for the completed application form with the pro forma agreement referred to  earlier and found in the Nkobi offices is dated 1 November 2000. He may well have sent the same application form to Th?tard on 8 December but it was not the first time he thought of using that as an instrument to obtain money from Thomson. Moreover, the completion of the application on 1 November was just before he went  to Mauritius to meet De Jomaron and Th?tard, two of the three Thomson's personnel concerned in the fax of 11 March, to discuss, amongst other things, \"damage control\" to their mutual interests. It seems at least very probable that this means of paying Zuma the promised money was decided then and the urgency noted in the 8 and 11 December faxes was due to the increasing pressure of the SCOPA committee to have the Special Investigation Unit brought into the inquiry into the corvettes contract. But the plan was derailed by the unexpected discovery that Shaik  had taken money marked by Zuma for Development Africa which he had already largely used in his group, and that was needed for the cost  of the Nkandla residence. It is also overwhelmingly likely to have been the reason why Shaik issued four post-dated cheques of R250 000 each to replace this, and he would not have done that without expectation of being able to meet those cheques somehow, sometime as his Kobitech cash projections show, in four tranches of commission from Thomson during 2001.

He won in Lanzhou last year in 2:11:54 and went on to make it on to the podium in Frankfurt and Rotterdam, reducing his PB each time. He clocked 2:06:56 to finish second in Frankfurt and 2:05:56 to place third in Rotterdam two months ago, making him the fastest in the field for this year's race. Gezahegn has a good record in China. Of the 13 marathons he has contested to date, seven have been in China, and he has won all but two of those. Little separates the top contenders, though, and Gezahegn will have to be at his best to win again. Fellow Ethiopian Abayneh Ayele set a course record of 2:10:10 when winning in Lanzhou in 2015. His PB of 2:06:45 was set in Dubai two years ago and he came close to it last year with 2:07:42 in Paris. So far this year he has finished on the podium in two Chinese marathons, placing second in Chongqing in 2:14:13 and third in Dongying in 2:13:47. Kenya's Ernest Ngeno finished third in Lanzhou last year in 2:12:24, just 30 seconds adrift of Gezahegn. He reduced his PB to 2:06:41 when finishing third in Paris earlier this year and has made it on to the podium in his eight most recent marathons. Two other Kenyans Dickson Tuwei and Andrew Kimutai, who clocked PBs of 2:08:22 and 2:08:32 respectively in Seville earlier this year, head to Lanzhou in good form. In the absence of last year's winner Ashete Bekele, Ethiopian Tigist Girma is one of the top runners in the women's race. Girma finished second in Lanzhou last year \u2013 an improvement on her seventh-place finish from 2016 \u2013 and she will be looking to move up another place on the podium in what will be her third Lanzhou appearance. But she faces a handful of women with significantly faster PBs than hers (2:29:05).

Mabongi Flora-Junior \"Shauwn\" Mpisane is accused of inflating invoices by more than R5 million to cut her tax bill. She is also accused of violating the Close Corporations Act by remaining the  sole member of Zikhulise Cleaning, Maintenance and Transport CC when she had a previous fraud conviction. She has pleaded not guilty. The court was holding a trial-within-a-trial to determine the admissibility of evidence submitted by the State. The State has submitted 148 invoices it obtained from Mpisane during the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process. The court made a ruling on two issues relating to documents submitted during  the ADR and Voluntary Disclosure Process (VDP). Both processes allow for a tax payer to submit documents to the South African Revenue Services without prejudice. Mpisane is accused of submitting revised 2008 financial statements when she applied for ADR in 2010. Other charges she faces relate to the contravention of the Vat Act. She submitted her 2009 and 2010 tax documents during the VDP process. According to SARS legislation, information obtained during this process cannot be used in subsequent proceedings. Msani said the question which was raised in the trial-within-the-trial was whether the confidentiality and without prejudice provision would extend to a situation where fraud was the basis of the matter. \"The challenge raised does not succeed,\" Msani said. The matter was adjourned for a pre-trial on February 13. Sapa  \/ns\/ma\/jje\/rod","label":0}
{"id":"5dc272186c767a0017f2cec2","url":"SAP20131012S6299.txt","text":"(=(PICTURE+VIDEO)=) African nations on Saturday urged the International Criminal Court to defer the crimes against humanity trials of Kenya's leadership as they convened a special summit on their worsening relations with the tribunal. The meeting at the African Union headquarters comes amid mounting tensions with the ICC, which has been accused of acting like a neo-colonialist institution that has singled out Africans since being set up as the world's first permanent court to try genocide and war crimes. In his opening speech, Ethiopian Prime Minister and AU chairperson Hailemariam Desalegn alleged that the Hague-based tribunal \"has continued to operate in complete disregard\" of African governments. \"I wish to note that 34 member states of our union joined the ICC perhaps fully convinced that the organisation would promote the cause of justice with a  sense of impartiality and fairness. The practice so far however leaves so much to be desired,\" he said. \"The unfair treatment that we have been subjected to is completely unacceptable,\" he added, accusing the court of ignoring efforts in Kenya and Sudan -- whose leaders have been indicted by the ICC -- to resolve their problems internally. \"The UN Security Council and the ICC should work with us to enable the elected leadership of Kenya to fulfil their constitutional obligations by urgently considering deferment of the ICC proceedings,\" AU executive council head Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma also told the gathering. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto have been charged with crimes against humanity for allegedly masterminding a vicious campaign of ethnic violence that left at least 1,100 dead and more than 600,000  homeless after disputed 2007 elections. Now allies and elected this year on a platform of national reconciliation, they argue the case is violating Kenyan sovereignty, undoing efforts at national reconciliation and hampering their running of the country. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who along with Kenyatta was among the heads of state attending the summit, is wanted by the court in The Hague on 10 counts of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Sudan's Darfur conflict. The ICC so far has issued indictments linked to conflicts in nine countries,  all of them in Africa. Diplomats with the 54-member AU say there was a sentiment the court -- which is an independent body and not part of the United Nations system -- was turning a blind eye to other parts of the world. African countries account for 34 of the 122 parties to have ratified the ICC's founding treaty, which took effect on July 1, 2002. A mass pull-out from the court -- as some countries have demanded -- could seriously damage the institution. The AU bloc, however, has been divided on the issue -- with countries like Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia and Rwanda taking a tough line, but other nations seemingly reluctant to get embroiled in a diplomatic confrontation. Zuma, a former anti-apartheid activist, acknowledged in her opening speech that African nations should \"do more to strengthen the capacity of our national  and continental judicial systems\" -- seen as a concession to several prominent African figures who have defended the court. South African anti-apartheid icon and Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu issued a stinging attack on the summit, saying that \"those leaders seeking to skirt the court are effectively looking for a licence to kill, maim and oppress  their own people.\" Former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, from Ghana, also said a pull-out would leave Africa wearing a \"badge of shame\". Kenya's leadership has so far pledged to cooperate with the court, with Ruto's trial underway and Kenyatta due in court on November 12. But the relationship has been soured by accusations of witness intimidation in Kenya and counter-complaints against the ICC that it has been manipulating witnesses and is inflexible. Following last month's Islamist militant attack on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall, Nairobi also demanded that Kenyatta be allowed to appear by video-link so he can deal with national security issues, and this week his lawyers alleged abuse of process and called for a halt in proceedings. Should the accused fail to turn up for any of the hearings that could trigger arrest warrants, with Kenya then running the risk of diplomatic isolation. Sudan's Bashir has refused to go to The Hague and is the subject of ICC arrest warrants. He has travelled to several African countries however since then. Sapa-AFP \/gq","label":1}

Court was already in session with Lamont addressing the lawyers present. Krejcir said \"Morning\" before he sat down. More than 10 heavily armed police officers, most in uniform, kept an eye on proceedings, with more officers outside. In June, the case was postponed because some of the accused still needed to sort out their legal representation, and some papers still had to be filed. National police commissioner Riah Phiyega, detective Colonel Nkosana \"Killer\" Ximba, crime intelligence boss Chris Ngcobo, as well as forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan had to file papers on why they were challenging subpoenas served on them by Krejcir's lawyers on June 23. Arguments on the subpoenas were expected to be heard on Monday. Phiyega was required to produce all documentation, which led to her reportedly ordering the arrest of Krejcir and one of his co-accused, Desai Luphondo, in November last year. The subpoena served on O'Sullivan, who is alleged to have assisted police in  their investigation, required him to produce all documentation linked to his investigation. His cellphone provider was subpoenaed to provide all his call and text records from June last year to February 2014, and it had done so. Krejcir, Luphondo, Warrant Officers Samuel \"Saddam\" Maropeng and George Nthoroane, and Jan Lefu Mofokeng and Siboniso Miya face charges of kidnapping, attempted murder, and dealing in drugs. They allegedly kidnapped Bheki Lukhele from his Katlehong home in June last year. He testified how he was bound, blindfolded, assaulted and had boiling water poured over him -- allegedly by Krejcir -- in an attempt to force him to reveal  the whereabouts of his brother Doctor. Doctor had allegedly disappeared with 25kg of tik (methamphetamine) which he  had been tasked to transport to Australia, allegedly for Krejcir. All the accused have denied involvement in the matter. Ximba's name has repeatedly come up in the trial with two State witness admitting to being friends with him. He was also issued a subpoena, ordering him to produce cellphone records as well his vehicle tracking records and that of his driver. Ngcobo had to produce records taken from tracking devices of the East Rand organised crime unit's fleet of cars. He would need to provide information on which of his officers were using them in June last year, when Lukhele was allegedly kidnapped and assaulted. On Monday, Lamont postponed the actual trial to Tuesday because Maropeng was  not in court. Krejcir's lawyer, Annelene van den Heever, said the State would call a new witness. After court, Krejcir kissed his wife before she gave him food. A police officer unpacked and searched all the items before Krejcir was allowed to take it. Sapa \/dm\/fg\/ar\/lp","label":0}

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in April, dropped 31 cents to 54.12 dollars a barrel in electronic deals. In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in April lost 20 cents to 52.90 dollars a barrel. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had been expected to maintain its production ceiling at 27 million barrels a day at Wednesday's meeting in Isfahan, Iran. Oil prices had risen earlier on Monday as speculative \"funds added to their length again,\" said Bache Financial trader Christopher Bellew. However, prices dipped following comments from Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Nuaimi, who said the OPEC kingpin would seek to  raise the ceiling by 500,000 barrels per day and would itself pump more crude later this year. \"World demand is forecast to grow in the last part of the year, which necessitates an increase in production,\" the official SPA news agency quoted him as saying. \"Hence Saudi Arabia will raise its production from the current level later this year,\" Nuaimi said. OPEC president Sheikh Ahmad Fahd al-Sabah also said on Monday that the 11-nation cartel might decide to increase oil production if the market requires it. \"Increasing production (will be) on the table\" at Wednesday's meeting in Isfahan, Sheikh Ahmad, who is also Kuwait's energy minister, told reporters before leaving for Iran. \"If we find there is a need to hike output, we will deal with it  in a responsible way,\" he said, referring to soaring oil prices. Some analysts believed a change to output was not on the cards. That was because the second quarter of the year was \"normally a period of low demand\", said Robert Skinner, director Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \"OPEC will probably just pass, and not increase quotas nor decrease them.\" The International Energy Agency (IEA) painted a picture of strong global demand last week when it revised upwards its 2005 forecasts for oil demand in a monthly report. It predicted demand growth of 2.2 percent -- or 1.8 million barrels per day -- compared with its previous forecast of a 1.8 percent increase. Sustained demand for crude was seen in the United States and above all China, where growth in demand was expected to slow from the 15.6 percent rate in 2004, to a still-strong pace of 7.9 percent, the IEA said. \"The expectation was that Chinese demand was going to cool off... but it is still surging ahead, it is going to be pretty robust,\" Skinner added.

Registrar Sharon Candy said she did not hear bail being granted to Sivion Mkhize, and would have tried to rectify the matter immediately had she been informed afterwards. She told the court she did record that Mkhize was granted leave to appeal against his murder and aggravated robbery convictions. Mkhize, 28, was convicted by Judge Leona Theron in the Dundee Circuit Court in February 2001.  Theron sentenced him to life for murder and 15 years for aggravated robbery at a garage near Ladysmith. Two of his co-accused absconded, leaving Mkhize as the sole accused. Theron granted him leave to appeal because part of the evidence against him rested on voice identification. She also granted him bail of R5000. Mkhize's leave to appeal was recorded, but not the granting of bail. He has lodged a R16 million claim against the ministry of justice and constitutional development for unlawful detention plus loss of earnings as a technician. Candy told the court she was probably out of the court performing routine tasks or an errand for her judge when the decision was made.  She often had to liaise between the high court and magistrate's court staff,  she said. The high court sat in the magistrate's court building during the trial. Mkhize was sent to Waterfall Prison in Utrecht where officials refused to release him on bail. Eventually, he wrote to the then KwaZulu-Natal Judge President Vuka Tshabalala, who wrote back to him informing him that he had been granted leave to appeal, but not bail. Despite efforts by Mkhize and his family to have the record set straight, he  stayed in jail until February 2004 when a full Bench set aside his conviction and freed him. An emotional Mkhize told the court he had started doubting his mental condition while in prison, as both he and his family knew he had been granted bail, but he was still in prison. He was held in the maximum security section of the prison, where he shared a  cell with about 35 other inmates, who formed gangs.  There was gang warfare almost every night, so he joined a gang for protection.  He lived in constant fear, and his relatives smuggled money to him to pay for protection. The ministry's counsel has opposed the claim on the basis that it is no longer valid as it is more than three years old. Acting Judge Piet Bezuidenhout postponed the case to December 10 for arguments. Sapa \/str\/gm\/ks\/cls","label":0}

Blair started the week facing predictions that a 24-hour period encompassing a knife-edge parliamentary vote and the publication of  a probe into government actions ahead of the Iraq war could even bring about his downfall. However on Tuesday, Blair's controversial plan to impose increased fees for university students squeaked through the House of Commons by five votes. The narrow victory came after last-minute negotiations persuaded  a handful of rebels from Blair's Labour Party not to join 72 of their comrades in voting against the measure. Even better new followed for the prime minister the next day, when a long-awaited report from judge Brian Hutton cleared Blair of  direct blame in events which led to the suicide of weapons expert David Kelly. Kelly killed himself in July after being named as the source of a BBC report alleging Blair's office had deliberately \"sexed up\" the risk faced by Iraq's illegal weaponry, an allegation Hutton dismissed as \"unfounded\". Blair was untainted by the Kelly affair in the end and even received an \"unreserved\" apology from the BBC for any harm done to his reputation by the erroneous report. \"He's had a fantastically good week.\" said Peter Oborne, political editor of The Spectator, a political weekly which has expounded the views of Britain's conservative elite for 175 years. \"The Hutton report findings are just fantastic for him. Amazing,\" he said. \"This has been hanging over him for six months. And the win on tuition fees -- I know it was very narrow, but it was a win. So he's had a fantastic week.\" However the close shave over university fees, when Labour's crushing 161-vote majority in the Commons all but evaporated, had been a real scare, Travers said. \"I would expect quite serious efforts to be made from now on from the Labour leadership, the cabinet and Blair to ensure that he  doesn't have that kind of trouble with backbench MPs again,\" he said. Building bridges with the public at large could be a tougher task. For all Hutton's unequivocal findings, there has been a growing chorus of media criticism that the judge was excessively deferential towards the government and accepted ministers' assurances of good faith without question. An opinion poll in Thursday's Evening Standard newspaper found that while 36 percent of people agreed with Hutton's verdict saying  the government had not acted underhandedly towards Kelly, 50 percent thought it had. Additionally, 70 percent felt that there should now be another inquiry into the wider question -- not touched on by Hutton -- of whether the government took Britain into the Iraq war under false pretences. The poll \"shows that public opinion will still be resistant to the idea that Hutton simply wiped the slate clean for Blair,\" noted  Travers. However analysts noted that if the week's events proved one thing, it was that Blair still possesses the one commodity most needed by politicians -- good fortune. \"There is no doubt that politicians need luck ... Blair undoubtedly has luck and it comes back when he needs it,\" said Travers. Others were less charitable, notably the editor of the right-wing Spectator magazine Boris Johnson, who is also a lawmaker  for the main opposition Conservative Party. \"It is just flipping unbelievable,\" he fumed of Blair's escape. \"He is a mixture of Harry Houdini and a greased piglet. He is barely human in his elusiveness. Nailing Blair is like trying to pin jelly to a wall.\" Sapa-AFP","label":0}

Attorney Kevin Snider declined to release the name of the hospital or its location, citing the privacy of 2-year-old Israel Stinson's family. The boy's mother Jonee Fonseca said in a posting Sunday on the website gofundme.com that the facility was outside the U.S. She said a neurologist and pediatric specialist who examined Israel at the new hospital determined he was not brain dead. The boy was receiving nutrients and was on a treatment plan, she said in the post on the fundraising site. Israel went to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Roseville on April 11 after treatment at the University of California, Davis Medical Center following what appeared to be an asthma attack, according to court documents. At UC Davis, he went into cardiac arrest and was later found to be brain dead. Two more evaluations at Kaiser Permanente also determined he was brain dead, Kaiser Permanente attorneys said. Fonseca had been looking to move the child out of Kaiser Permanente, where doctors said his condition wouldn't improve. She said Israel had moved his body in response to her touch and voice, and she believed he was still alive as long as his heart was beating. A federal appeals court on Friday gave Fonseca more time to find another facility for Israel, ordering Kaiser Permanente to continue life support while it considered his mother's appeal. A lower court had extended life support only to the end of the business day Friday. Snider said Fonseca's appeal is now moot. Kaiser Permanente confirmed in a statement that Israel was no longer at the hospital. \"Our primary goals have always been to offer our support to Israel's family and follow the courts' direction,\" said Chris Palkowski, chief of staff at Kaiser Permanente in Roseville. \"We hope this transfer brings peace for Israel's family.\" Fonseca filed a lawsuit in state court to prevent Kaiser Permanente from removing Israel from life support. A judge ruled against her last month. Fonseca filed a separate federal lawsuit, arguing that state law doesn't allow patients to bring in their own doctors to challenge the finding of death, and that violates due-process rights under the U.S. Constitution.","label":0}

Ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized nations called at the end of two-day talks for increased energy efficiency to smooth out oil prices and floated the idea of a trust fund that would help oil-consuming countries deal with price shocks. The also stressed the need for fiscal consolidation in the United States and further structural reforms in Europe, Russia and Japan. \"Vigorous action is required by each country to support a smooth  adjustment to more balanced growth,\" the ministers said in a communique. While the talks ahead of the G8 leaders summit in Scotland next month focused on a debt relief agreement for the world's poorest nations, the finance chiefs pinpointed oil prices in a separate statement on economic issues. They called for greater investment in increased energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy as they said that \"sustained high energy prices are of significant concern since they  hamper global economic growth.\" The ministers welcomed efforts to reduce energy market volatility by improving data to make it more transparent, and pushed for the development of a global framework for the reporting of oil reserves. \"We urge oil-producing countries and companies and consumers to recognize their common interest in ensuring investment in sufficient future supplies of oil and refining capacity, and call on countries and institutions to work to remove barriers and create  a climate conducive to investment throughout the supply chain,\" they added. Crude oil prices rose sharply last year as a surge in global demand and unplanned outages left excess capacity hovering about 1 percent above daily consumption of over 82 million barrels daily. Crude futures remain about 40 percent higher than a year ago. British Treasury Chief Gordon Brown said that ministers had agreed to push for a trust fund with the International Monetary Fund to help oil consuming nations handle price shocks. \"We took note of the fact that as a result of the rising oil prices, oil producers were in a better position with greater revenues than had been anticipated ... we are asking the oil producers to contribute to this new trust fund,\" Brown said. Brown said he has already written to oil companies about the trust fund and spoken with senior finance ministers about the idea.  \"I believe there can be support for this proposal,\" he said. The finance ministers' statement comes just days after OPEC representatives met with EU officials in Brussels, the first talks at that level between the two organizations, to discuss issues of energy supply security and cooperation. EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs called on OPEC president Sheik Ahmed Fahd Al Sabah to raise the group's production to help dampen prices. Al Sabah said that OPEC members, who are due to meet Wednesday in Vienna, seem to have agreed to keep production at current levels, but the group may raise its ceiling by 500,000 barrels a day later this year. However some analysts dismiss such a move since OPEC is already producing above its quota and the only member with the known ability to add barrels is Saudi Arabia. U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow acknowledged the communique's reference to the United States' large budget deficit, saying that the Bush administration was well on the path to reducing it. \"The private sector forecasters now have the deficit coming in well below the initial target of US{dollar}427 billion for the year, much more in the range of the mid-US{dollar}300s,\" he said. \"We understand that  we have an obligation there and we take it seriously and we are not  only going to meet our commitments, I'm confident we are going to exceed those commitments.\" Snow called on Europe and Japan to speed up economic reform and,  in a veiled reference to China, said Asia needs foreign exch","label":0}

Jiba and her colleague advocate Lawrence Mrwebi are the subject of the commission of inquiry into their fitness to hold office. The inquiry is looking into alleged anomalies raised regarding the pair's conduct in several court cases, including the decision to withdraw charges against former head of Crime Intelligence, Richard Mdluli.

The women's race meanwhile comes down to the wire as Ingvild Flugstad Oestberg takes a 38.7-second advantage over fellow Norwegian Therese Johaug into the concluding 9-kilometre pursuit Sunday with the gruelling Alpe Cermis climb. Sundby dominated the seventh stage, a 15km classic style mass start, crossing the line in 39 minutes 55.2 seconds, 7.7 seconds ahead of compatriot Niklas Dyrhaug and 12.6 clear of Kazakhstan's Alexey Poltoranin. The win moved Sundby 2:51.5 minutes clear at the top of the Tour standings, ahead of compatriot Petter Northug who all but lost his chances of a first title in his 10th attempt by coming 17th on the day, more than 50 seconds behind Sundby. While Sundby appears to have closed in on the Tour title, the rest of the podium is still up for grabs, with less than 10 seconds separating Northug from fifth-placed Finn Haagen Krogh, with Poltoranin and Russia's Sergey Ustiugov in-between. On the women's side, Heidi Weng led another Norwegian sweep in her first career World Cup win after 37 previous podium finishes when she beat Oestberg and Johaug for a 10km victory in 29:16.3 minutes. Oestberg trailed by eight tenths, with the World Cup leader and 2014 Tour winner Johaug another 5.4 seconds behind in third place. \"I cannot believe it, it is so crazy and hard to describe it. I was the best today and I still cannot believe it,\" Weng said. Oestberg has a healthy advantage over Johaug going into Sunday's finale, but the nature of the stage with the steep final climb means she is not yet assured of first place. Weng is a distant third overall, 2:26.7 behind. \"It will be very tough race tomorrow. I know Ingvild can be fast on the climbs too. I have good memories about this hill but I have to have a good day tomorrow,\" the three-time 2015 world champion Johaug said. # Notebook ## Note to editors - adds men's race, details, quotes, byline * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Gerald Fritsche - Editing by: John Bagratuni - Tel: +49-30-285231472; dpa gfs bag dtw","label":0}

Tom Latham's career-best 137 (121 balls) \u2013 only his second century in his 47th ODI \u2013 had driven New Zealand to an imposing 341\/7, and Bangladesh's chase subsided at 264 all out in 44.5 overs, with nine wickets falling and Mushfiqur Rahim having retired hurt. Latham was well supported by Colin Munro, who smashed 87 off 61 after coming in at No 6 and sharing in a 158-run stand with Latham for the fifth wicket that came off a mere 107 balls and swung the game away from Bangladesh. The Latham-Munro duo had come together with the team on 158\/4 in the 29th over, with none of the other top-order batsmen able to stick around for any great length of time alongside Latham. But the big-hitting Munro and the in-form Latham then got together to put the score beyond Bangladesh's reach. Kane Williamson had won the toss and New Zealand progressed steadily in the first half of its innings. Martin Guptill seemed primed for a blistering start and smacked an early six, but he misread a slower ball from Mustafizur Rahman and ended up skying to Soumya Sarkar at mid-off for 15. Williamson had moved briskly to 31, hitting five fours, but was undone by Taskin Ahmed to leave his side 79\/2 in the 15th over. Neil Broom (22) and Jimmy Neesham (12) also couldn't stick around for long, but the complexion of the game changed when Munro joined Latham. They drove New Zealand to its highest score in 26 matches against Bangladesh, and their 158-run stand was also a New Zealand record highest for the fifth wicket against the visiting side. Latham survived an early scare when a Mashrafe Mortaza delivery sailed just over the off-stump when he was on 7, but otherwise, he remained unflustered. He eventually fell in the 48th over, caught by Rahim off Mustafizur after having smacked seven fours and four sixes during his innings. Munro, who hit eight fours and four sixes, had fallen just an over earlier, becoming Shakib Al Hasan's third victim. Shakib would end with the best figures for Bangladesh, taking 3\/69. He also was his team's highest scorer, hitting 59 off 54 in a flagging chase. Mustafizur, in his first ODI in five months following shoulder surgery, took two wickets, as did Taskin. Bangladesh's chase was off to a rocky start. Tamim Iqbal made 38, but took up 59 deliveries, while Imrul Kayes, Sarkar and Mahmudullah contributed only 17 between them as it slumped to 81\/4 in 18 overs. Neesham took three of the wickets to fall, wrecking the Bangladesh chase before it could get a decent platform. Shakib and Rahim then got together for a 63-run stand that was developing well at better than a run-a-ball, before Shakib was caught by Tim Southee off Lockie Ferguson. Rahim reached 42 when a hamstring strain ended his innings, but by then Bangladesh was 219\/6 and the required run rate had ballooned to 10.69. Mosaddek Hossain did offer some late resistance, remaining 50 not out off 44 balls for his first ODI half-century, but that only served to reduce the margin of defeat. For New Zealand, Neesham's 3\/36 were the best figures, while Ferguson also got among the wickets with 3\/54. The second match in the series will take place in Nelson on Thursday. - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

She said if this year's general elections went smoothly, it would be the second time the country had successfully completed them on its own. In 1994 the international community largely helped  conduct and monitor the election. \"This (2004) election can establish South Africa as a country which can at least manage its affairs in terms of the elections,\" said Ngidi, highlighting that with elections planned in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola, these two countries in particular were looking to \"take lessons\" from South Africa. She said 15 EISA election monitors -- all from the Southern African Development Community -- would be deployed on Friday to Gauteng, the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape to monitor the elections. Ngidi said the teams would meet interested parties, including the Independent Electoral Commission, civil society, the media and political parties, in each region to get \"various perspectives of election issues\". Referring to the controversial Zimbabwe election which kept President Robert Mugabe in power, and which elicited much debate on  whether or not it was \"free and fair\", Ngidi said the EISA and the Electoral Commissions Forum had adopted a 30-page document to help guide observers on what to look for in elections when determining they were free and fair. The Electoral Commission Forum consists of the 14 IECs in the SADC region. Asked about the adequacy of the document, Ngidi said: \"It is very elaborate and extremely thorough,\" adding that it looked for example at the role of state security forces during elections, voter fraud, the secrecy of the vote, and whether voting stations were free of violence and intimidation. Ngidi said the EISA would compile a report and submit it to the IEC once the elections had run their course. Sapa","label":0}

The unit is jointly funded by the City of Cape Town, the Western Cape Government and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). The unit has recorded about 36 arrests on a range of charges including assault, possession of drugs and stolen property, malicious damage to property and theft, confiscations of 379,5 metres of cable and 800 kilograms of railway signal cable, among other successes, according to the Western Cape transport and public works. The REU has been a force multiplier for Prasa's Regional Protection Services Unit. Together, the teams have ensured greater operational visibility on trains and stations, searching more individuals during joint operations, confiscating a greater number of dangerous weapons and fraudulent train tickets. \"With enforcement success on track, the next priority should be closing down non-compliant scrap dealers and lobbying for legislative changes to permit only traceable electronic payment methods. The current practice of cash-for-copper-no-questions-asked encourages illegal and illicit scrap dealing,\" said Metrorail Western Cape regional manager, Richard Walker. Western Cape member of the executive council (MEC) for transport and public works and chairperson of the RMTT, Donald Grant said that they launched the initiative with the intention to increase security on our rail network as the situation had reached dire straits with arson, vandalism, cable theft, and violent crime becoming commonplace. \"An intervention was urgently required, and through effective intergovernmental cooperation we were able to get the REU off the ground,\" he said. \"The initial results and arrests are testaments to the initiative's effectiveness and our officers' commitment on the ground. Our Rail Management Task Team (RMTT) is continuing to explore ways in which to dramatically improve rail for the thousands of commuters who rely on this mode of transport.\" - African News Agency (ANA); Editing by Devereaux Morkel","label":0}

He no longer is simply happy to be at Sheshan International alongside the world's top players. India's best golfer now has a chance to wrap up the Order of Merit on the Asian Tour. Lahiri also is No. 15 in the Race to Dubai on the European Tour, so along with trying to state his case as rookie of the year, he still has a chance to work his way into the top five and qualify for the bonus pool. And if that's not enough, it's critical for him to get his first season on the PGA Tour off to a strong start and to stay in the top 50 in the world (he's at No. 39). \"Obviously, my focus has changed,\" Lahiri said Wednesday with an easy smile. \"The event is still really important, but the perspective is radically different. I guess the golf isn't radically different. It's the same thing. You have to go out there and do the same things. But a lot has changed in the last 12 months.\" It started early in the year when Lahiri won twice in three weeks on the European Tour, which shot him into the top 50 in the world and made him eligible for the majors and the WGCs. A tie for fifth in the PGA Championship locked up a spot in the Presidents Cup. Before heading to South Korea, the 28-year-old made a detour to the Web.com Tour where he played well enough in two events to earn a PGA Tour card. That was critical to get some rest ahead of a long stretch at the end of the year on the Asian and European tours. Playing on two tours is difficult enough. Lahiri is trying to juggle three tours at once. He chose to play the CIMB Classic in Malaysia last week to keep his lead on the Asian Tour and get a start on his PGA Tour season. But that meant skipping the Turkish Airlines Open, the first of four events in The Final Series on the European Tour. \"It's been a balancing act,\" he said. \"But I think at the end of the day, if you play good, solid golf, everything else becomes secondary. All the great players play just 20 events and it's enough for them because they are good enough to do whatever they need to do. Now hopefully, that is something that I can aspire to do in the time to come.\" Still, there are tough decisions ahead. Winning the Asian Tour money title gives him a five-year exemption. His victories on the European Tour made him exempt through 2017. But his goal all along was to play the PGA Tour, and that's where his priorities lie for next season. Whether he remains a man of three tours depends largely on how Europe alters its minimum number of tournaments required for membership. \"How extensively I play in Europe is something that I'm still considering,\" Lahiri said. \"There's a lot of chopping and changing going on in the minimum number of events and how the criteria work, especially with the Olympics next year. The schedules are getting squeezed more and more, so there's a lot more events that are overlapping. But my focus is going to be primarily in America.\" What brought Lahiri as much fame as any victory was a loss in singles to Chris Kirk, which proved to be the decisive match in the Presidents Cup. Lahiri's 4-foot birdie putt caught the lip and spun away, but he stayed longer than any International team player to answer any question and was quick to credit Kirk for making a big putt of his own. He followed that with a runner-up finish in Macau and a tie for seventh in the Hong Kong Open. Now he's trying to get on the kind of run that sparked him season nine months ago. He's been watching and admiring Matthew Fitzpatrick, the 21-year-old from England who won the British Masters and qualified for his first WGC this week. \"In golf, as you'll see with most players, we get on a run,\" Lahiri said. \"When you get on a good run, you can really make it count. I had a good run early in the year and I made a big jump, and Matthew is doing the same thing. I remember playing with Jordan Spieth right here one year ago, and that was before he got on the biggest run that I've ever seen anyone get on. Runs are fantastic. Hopefully, both mine and Matt's continue.\" Lahiri also played Sheshan International last year with J.B. Holmes, one of the longest hitters in the game. Lahiri has plenty of power himself \u2014 he won the Long Drive Competition at the PGA Championship this year \u2014 though he has learned the difference between what he calls \"long, long and really long.\" He's not in the league of Dustin Johnson and Bubba Watson. But he has more than enough. \"Back in India we have a term which is 'Sunday Special,' which is probably the best shot you could ever hit,\" Lahiri said. \"If you were playing a video game, it's the one where Tiger hits it and the ball gets on fire. When I hit that, I'm probably 5 or 10 yards behind these guys. And that's pretty good.\"","label":0}

Children's home manager Martie Booyse told the court Visser had admitted to allegations levelled by the two girls, who spent separate weekends with the couple in February and March 2002. The 11-year-old girl claimed that Visser used a vibrator in front of her, had asked her to touch her surgically enhanced breasts, and told her to touch Prinsloo's private parts as he was lying in the bath. The girl said she had been exposed to pornographic videos and magazines and was asked to walk about naked. A 15-year-old said she was shown sexually explicit videos and claimed the couple had engaged in intimate acts before her. Booyse said the 11-year-old related the allegations to her on the Monday after spending a weekend with the pair. The older girl, who had visited the couple about two weekends earlier, was then called in and confirmed she had had similar experiences. Visser came to the children's home the Tuesday to bring the 11-year-old a fruit basket, Booyse said. She denied her access to the child, and confronted her with the allegations. \"She admitted everything. I was completely taken aback.\" Under cross-examination from Prinsloo's counsel, Philip Loubser,  Booyse was unable to explain why some of the most serious allegations, including the 11-year-old being asked to touch Prinsloo's private parts, were never included in initial statements  taken from the children. It was also not initially stated that Visser had touched Prinsloo's private parts in front of the 15-year-old. Booyse could not say why the older girl had not immediately reported the alleged incidents, but told the court the child felt guilty for having waited so long given the subsequent experiences of the her housemate. Visser's legal counsel, Casper Badenhorst, failed to challenge any of the claims. There were expressions of disbelief in the public gallery when he declined to cross-examine Booyse. The trial resumed on Tuesday after a six-month delay, and is set  to continue next Monday. Charges against the couple include two of rape -- one involving a minor and the other a woman. Both alleged victims claim to have been drugged by the couple. There were three charges of soliciting a 15-year-old girl to commit indecent acts on different occasions. In the alternative, they are charged with exposing themselves to the girl and\/or performing sexual acts in front of her and\/or showing her pornographic material.  They are charged with four counts of indecent assault -- two of them involving an 11-year-old girl and the others two different women.  Also on the indictment are charges of possessing and manufacturing child pornography, and possessing dagga.  Prinsloo faces an additional charge of assaulting one of the complainants.  The State alleges the couple committed fraud by pretending to be  married so as to obtain temporary supervision over minors from a children's home in order to abuse them over weekends. They have pleaded not guilty on all counts and are out on R4000 bail each. Visser came into the public eye after a failed bid to become a pop star and because of her surgically enhanced bosom. She has been  nicknamed \"Advocate Barbie\" after the blonde, busty plastic doll.  The trial has been set down until December 12. Sapa","label":0}

This resolution taken by the Presidential Infrastructure Co-ordinating Commission had basically allowed construction companies to get away with serious corruption scot-free. \"But what can we expect from a national government which has basically accepted corruption as commonplace? This is not co-operation between government and the private sector. It is a complete lack of accountability which is being wholly endorsed by Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti as the chairperson of the commission,\" De Lille said. The only \"punishment\" these massive companies faced was the creation of a R1.5 billion slush fund which they were now coerced to contribute towards and which was supposed to further transformation. The construction industry should be prioritising transformation in any case. It was simply ridiculous that ratepayers' money, \"which construction companies stole\", was being used to help them diversify. Essentially, residents were paying for the crimes and failures of construction companies. \"The municipalities who agreed to this arrangement have failed themselves and their residents. National government should be ashamed that it misled the country into thinking that municipalities would be compensated for collusion by construction companies,\" she said. \"This is exactly why the City of Cape Town refused to settle and hand over our battle to the national government. We will fight for justice and the return of the R429.4 million owed to our residents. It is a long road ahead of us but we are very prepared to walk it. \"We will not be thwarted by delaying tactics intended to try and demotivate us. The City of Cape Town has instituted its claim. We know that WBHO, Stefanutti Stocks, and Aveng Africa are hopeful that if they can raise sufficient hurdles they will be excluded from the proceedings.

Dramatic changes have been effected to immigration laws, with the two-year limit on the tenure of foreign workers to be doubled; recent prospective changes to Black Economic Empowerment Codes will introduce the \"once-empowered, always empowered\" principle, aiming to ensure that BEE partners are not locked indefinitely into corporate deals; and efforts to manage the HIV\/Aids pandemic have been bolstered by the comments of Deputy Health Minister Nozizwe Madladlana-Routledge, who is now assisting Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in her new role as the government representative responsible for this critical sphere of health care.    These policy alterations point to an important principle: the need to focus on policy more than on personalities. While the ANC national conference, where the next president of South Africa will almost certainly be chosen, is of cardinal importance, the policy conference scheduled for June 2007 has not attracted the same interest. Whoever emerges as the presidential successor will be largely constrained by the overall policy choices the ANC makes.  In this regard it is important for intellectuals, political parties, agents in civil society and others to pay attention to the  call by presidential policy guru Joel Netshitenzhe for a \"festival of ideas\". Economic policy, government capacity and the three-tier structure of government are all subject to this \"festival\". Netshitenzhe also noted that the ANC had to decide what kind of party it wanted to be before it could decide who should lead it.  Policy has increasingly become an arena of struggle in the succession debate, as was seen recently at the 9th Cosatu Conference. Fiscal conservatism and the Gear strategy were referred  to derogatively and Gear's successor, AsgiSA, was criticised by Cosatu General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi in his socio-economic report. The SACP's Blade Nzimande has called for the Freedom Charter to guide the economy, ignoring the country's constitution in the process.  A number of interesting, insufficiently debated, challenges are emerging on economic policy, including:  * comments on inflation-targeting by key government advisers advocating a focus on the exchange rate that conflicts with recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) advice;  * recent IMF counsel favouring a conservative approach to public  expenditure;  * the possible use of tax incentives to leverage certain sectors  of the economy as part of AsgiSA.  South Africa's search for an enhanced macro-economic reform model contains many policy challenges. Crucial decisions will be probed at cabinet level and will be contested by tripartite alliance allies at the ANC policy conference.   Whatever casualties there may be in the succession debate, these  must not be policies that are crucial to maintaining the relative economic and political stability South Africa has managed to achieve in 12 years.

Lekota told journalists that he wanted more matrics to consider the military as a career, saying defence was about more than warfare, it was also about developing a skilled and disciplined citizenry. Last week 4200 new recruits -- out of 75,000 applicants -- joined the SA National Defence Force countrywide. This was the SANDF's largest ever volunteer intake, the minister  said. Lekota said he wanted more applicants and more money in his budget to accommodate at least another 2000 recruits this year. He hoped to convince the education and labour ministries to make  more funds available for him to take in another batch of the recruits in July. As an alternative, his department would consider borrowing money. Asked at Waterkloof Airforce Base why he wanted more applicants,  Lekota answered that greater numbers would help sensitise the Cabinet, which he thought was not doing enough to help either unemployed youths or young people who could not afford to study. Lekota also said he was concerned that young people and their parents were not aware of the many opportunities in the military for pilots, navigators, naval combat officers, engineers and accountants. He said it was not helpful for his department to have programmes  for training the youth if information about them was not available to those who qualified. The department also had a training scheme, called foundation training, for matrics with poor marks who aspired to be pilots and the like. Over 1100 students had already passed through this scheme and about 200 would be enrolled this year. Students on this course received basic military training in the mornings and academic training in the afternoons. At the end of the training year they rewrote those matric subjects in which they had fared poorly. At the briefing the minister welcomed two young women, from previously disadvantaged backgrounds, into the SA Air Force. Khanyisile Simelane and Thabisile Mahole, both 18 and from Tsakane at Brakpan, matriculated with average grades last year and Lekota was keen to help them and others in their position. \"A few weeks ago they were in despair... and their career hopes had come to a standstill.

The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission (SRCC) for Somalia Ambassador Francisco Caetano Madeira has strongly condemned the terror attack. \"I am saddened by the loss of innocent lives through acts of terror committed by ruthless individuals who have no value for life,\" Madeira said in a statement issued in Mogadishu. The AU envoy said the pan African body's forces AMISOM working in-conjunction with the Somali National Security Forces and other partners have renewed efforts to degrade and neutralize this terror organization. \"This objective is being pursued with the determination and commitment it deserves,\" he added. The terror attack occurred in a busy street in Baidoa town, in the south-central Bay region of Somalia. Al-Shabaab, which has links to Al-Qaida, carries out frequent attacks in Somalia, often targeting government officials and African Union troops. The Islamist militant group controlled most of southern Somalia as recently as 2010 but was pushed into the countryside by AU and the Somali government forces. The attack came a few hours after African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) summit held in Djibouti on Sunday called for increased funding to military operations in Somalia Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said for AMISOM to achieve the strategic objective of stabilizing the country, there is need to increase the forces land, air and maritime capabilities and equipment. The Head of State and Government Summit of countries contributing troops and police to AMISOM agreed that AMISOM lacks the requisite force multipliers to effectively deliver on its mandate. Other challenges facing AMISOM include recommendations by the Joint AU-UN benchmarking exercise conducted on April 14-25 to replace military forces with Police Formed Units. Kenyatta shared Kenya's own internal review that points to the need for a surge of both military and police units within the shortest time possible, preferably before the 2016 election in Somalia. The African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security Smail Chergui said aggressive operations against Al-Shabaab militants must be fast-tracked and thanked the troop contributing countries for their commitment, saying their efforts are not in vain. \"We need to promote mobility of AMISOM forces. This will increase pressure on Al-Shabaab militants and strengthen the Government of Somalia,\" Chergui. AU official said the summit in a joint communique recommended a review of immediate operational requirements for AMISOM and Somali National Security Forces to bolster the war against Al-Shabaab.

Border security on the Danish-German border was tightened on January 4 following a similar decision by Sweden. The Danish ministry said that continuing Swedish border controls and a \"historically high\" number of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers arriving in Germany meant that many of undocumented migrants could be stranded in Denmark. \"Such accumulation could threaten public order and internal security in Denmark, and we must take it seriously. It is therefore necessary that we extend border controls,\" Migration Minister Inger Stojberg said, as cited on the ministry's website. Denmark has extended border controls on its southern border six times, most recently on April 3. The Nordic country invoked Schengen Area border regulations, which allow temporary border controls in case of a serious threat to a member nation's public policy or internal security.","label":0}

The reduced rates on certain \"labor-intensive services\" were adopted in 1999 as a means to create jobs and combat the so-called \"black economy.\" They are applied in Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portland and Britain on  such things as shoe repairs, home renovations, housekeepers and hairdressers. \"What we are proposing is the simple extension\" of the current scheme, said Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd. \"It's not the Commission's preferred option.\" The Commission proposed in July revamping the system, claiming the exemptions in different countries distorted the single market. But it faced opposition from countries like Britain, which wanted to keep its zero rate on children's clothing. That also tied up a proposed new exemption that France had lobbied for: allowing French restaurants to chop the sales tax they  must charge diners from the current 19.6 percent down to 5.5 percent - the rate fast-food restaurants charge. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said Tuesday he would  request a special EU finance ministers meeting this month to try to  push that exemption through, despite opposition from Germany, which  doesn't want to have to offer it to its own restaurateurs. Tax issues require unanimous approval of the 15 EU governments. Todd said it would be up to Italy, which holds the EU's rotating  presidency, to call a special meeting.

The move comes a week after the acting mayor, Fawzia Peer, announced the ANC would not do so, which resulted in a public spat within her caucus. The write-off saw opposition parties claim it would create a precedent for other debtors to ask for similar treatment, despite it being against city policy. The turnaround by the ANC, according to the DA's Thabani Mthethwa, was because Peer was \"strong-armed into taking a different view\" by her party. The minutes from the previous meeting reflect Peer was in favour of not approving the recommendation but that \"members of the ANC subsequently submitted a contrary view\". The minutes said that ANC considered it made \"business sense\" to scrap the interest on the debt, and that the department had committed to honour paying its remaining debt to the city. \"This is an insult to all ratepayers out there. It cannot be that an arm of government wants a municipality to write its debt off purely on the basis that their budget didn't allow for them to pay it. It is unfair,\" Mthethwa said. \"The write-off is contrary to credit control and debt collection policy but it is recommended that interest be written-off in a once-off non-precedented basis,\" the report that is supported by the ANC states. The ANC holds the majority vote in the executive council. Last week Peer said the write-off would not happen and told the chamber the ANC caucus had agreed to this. \"We are saying we are not accepting any form of write-off. \"Our credit control act clearly says we can't write-off interest. We have taken a decision not to allow the write-off,\" Peer had said. Her comments were at odds with ANC chief whip Nelly Nyanisa and executive member Sipho Kaunda. Nyanisa eventually stormed out of the chamber over the issue and the matter was deferred to this week. DPW is the custodian of government properties in KZN and thus responsible for the payment of rates on those properties to the city. According to the City Treasury report tabled before the executive committee, Public Works budgeted R273-million to be paid in city rates in 2017\/18, when in fact they were billed R323-million, leaving a shortfall of R50 million. It is on this R50-million that the R7.4 million interest had been raised, as of 30 April 2019. Speaker William Mapena said the debt write-off must be seen in the context of the total bill paid. \"This is just the interest. The rates will still be recouped. We are saying it is a once-off provision. We will view each case on its merits,\" Mapena said. The DA caucus leader, Nicole Graham, said the city should not think the move would not set a precedent. \"Once it happens the first time it will happen again once people realise we do not keep to our own policies,\" Graham said. - African News Agency (ANA); Editing by Naomi Mackay","label":0}

Details of the settlement were announced Friday in federal court in Honolulu. It's still subject to City Council approval. The council is expected to consider the settlement at a July 6 meeting, said Honolulu Deputy Corporation Counsel Nicolette Winter. Courtney Wilson and Taylor Guerrero were visiting Hawaii from Los Angeles last year when, according to the their lawsuit, they were harassed and arrested because the officer didn't like their public displays of affection in a Foodland store on Oahu's North Shore. They were walking through the aisles holding hands and at one point hugged and kissed, the lawsuit said. Officer Bobby Harrison, who was shopping in uniform, \"observed their consensual romantic contact and, in a loud voice, ordered plaintiffs to stop and 'take it somewhere else.'\" The women complied and continued shopping, the lawsuit said. When Harrison again saw them being affectionate with each other, he threatened to have them thrown out of the store. While the women were in the check-out line, Harrison grabbed Wilson by the wrist, and she started to call 911, the women described last year. All three got into a scuffle and Harrison arrested them. They were charged with felony assault on an officer and spent three days in jail. Charges were eventually dismissed. After the lawsuit was filed, the Honolulu Police Department opened an internal investigation. Results of the investigation weren't immediately available Friday. The settlement dismisses Harrison from the lawsuit and isn't an admission of any wrongdoing, Winter said. Wilson said she and Guerrero are no longer a couple but remain friends. She went back to Los Angeles while Guerrero decided to stay in Honolulu. \"I'm glad it's over, but at the same time we wanted the officer to suffer some sort of repercussion,\" Wilson said. Guerrero ended up working and living in Honolulu partly because a condition of their release from jail required them to say on the island.

The Syrian Foreign Ministry said jets struck the camp on Sunday in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour, condemning the attack as \"blatant aggression.\" US military spokesman Steve Warren denied the coalition had conducted the alleged strike. If confirmed, the attack would be the first against President Bashar al-Assad's forces since the US-led air campaign started in Syria more than a year ago. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, reported that the suspected US-led coalition airstrike hit a Syrian army post near an Islamic State stronghold in Deir al-Zour. Four soldiers were killed in the bombardment, according to the Britain-based Observatory. The al-Assad regime controls most of the Deir al-Zour neighbourhoods along the western banks of the Euphrates, while Islamic State controls most of the centre of the oil-rich province. \"We know for sure that the strike was not launched by Russian planes because Moscow is an ally of al-Assad's regime,\" Observatory chief Rami Abdel-Rahman told dpa. Russia began its aerial campaign in Syria in September with the aim of targeting Islamic State and other radical groups. In recent weeks, the US-led alliance and Russia have separately stepped up airstrikes on Islamic State-held areas in Syria in retaliation for deadly attacks claimed by the al-Qaeda splinter group in several parts of the world. In Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country would host a ministerial meeting of the global coalition against Islamic State next month. No exact date has been set for the talks, which should take place in Rome in the second half of January, according to a spokesman for Gentiloni. Major world powers have also intensified diplomatic efforts to reach a political solution to Syria's conflict, now in its fifth year. Saudi Arabia has said it will host this week a meeting for moderate Syrian opposition groups aimed at unifying their ranks ahead of planned peace talks between representatives of the opposition and al-Assad's government. There are conflicting reports about when the meeting will exactly start in the Saudi capital Riyadh. On Sunday, Saudi Arabia said the gathering would open on Tuesday and run for three days. However, member of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, Samir al-Nashar, said the conference had been postponed to Wednesday for further preparations. \"The conference will start on Wednesday and last for a week,\" al-Nashar, who will attend the meeting, told dpa. Syria's moderate opposition factions have been weakened by divisions, allowing jihadist rebels, mainly Islamic State, to establish a foothold in the country. Saudi Arabia is a financial and diplomatic backer of opposition forces fighting to oust al-Assad. The oil-rich kingdom has repeatedly called for al-Assad to step down to end his country's multi-sided conflict, which is estimated to have claimed more than 250,000 lives. # Notebook ## Note to editors - Recasts with US denial; adds planned Rome meeting and confusion about Riyadh talks; changes dateline * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Weedah Hamzah in Beirut and Alvise Armellini in Rome - Editing by: Monica Raymunt - Tel: +49 30 2852 31472; dpa wh raf ar jot alv mnr","label":0}

GSK said earlier it had struck a deal with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over production problems of two key drugs at its Puerto Rico plant. Meanwhile, turnover at the group rose 4.0 percent to 5.036 billion pounds, matching analysts' predictions. \"GSK is off to an excellent start in 2005,\" said chief executive  Jean-Pierre Garnier. Investors cheered the positive news as GlaxoSmithKline topped the FTSE 100 index of leading shares, surging 6.53 percent to 1322 pence. The FTSE nudged up 0.06 percent to 4792.50 points. \"We are now entering a new phase of growth for the company as the impact of generic competition diminishes and the underlying strength of our business shows through,\" Garnier added. \"GSKs future is bright and in 2005 we are on track to deliver our guidance of earnings-per-share growth in the low double-digit range.\" Last month, the group said that the FDA had halted distribution of two of its medicines -- depression and anxiety treatment Paxil CR tablets and type 2 diabetes treatment Avandamet, also in tablet form -- due to unspecified \"manufacturing issues\". GSK said Thursday it has agreed to remedy the problems, without having to pay any fine, and it expects to resume deliveries of the affected drugs to the US market in the middle of this year. \"GlaxoSmithKline today announced that it has reached agreement on a Consent Decree with the FDA regarding the companys Cidra, Puerto Rico, manufacturing site,\" the company said in a separate statement. \"Based on the terms of the Consent Decree, the company can continue to manufacture products at the site, and expects to begin re-supplying the US and other markets with both Paxil CR and Avandamet in mid-year.\" Sapa-AFP","label":0}

Today Inge is making her name as a model in the fashion industry. As a famous sport star and now model, she knows how important it is to have a beautiful smile.  But for many years she wouldn't have dreamed of being a model because she had six upper teeth that she was unhappy with, until she decided to beautify them with individualised all-ceramic Procera porcelain facades.  \"I regret no day that I beautified my teeth. My new teeth opened  the doors for my career as a model. I receive many compliments and I'm so happy that I would like to smile the whole day.

Authorities said decades of neglected infrastructure were behind the blackout that struck shortly after 10:00 am (1500 GMT). About one third of customers had power restored by 2:00 pm (1900 GMT) By early afternoon local time, local power supplier DTE Energy said they expected the lights to be back on later in the day. Its chief, Jerry Norcia, said a problem with two cables brought down a major chunk of the grid.

Dozens of buildings were evacuated and the city's driver-less train system temporarily suspended service, reports said. Without functioning traffic lights, police took up positions at intersections to direct the flow of cars. The city, the most populous in the state of Michigan despite a shrinking population base, declared bankruptcy in July 2013 after years of financial woes.

He has been charged with the Valentine's Day shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius was brought to court early from the Brooklyn police cells where he  had been in custody since his first appearance on Friday. He was brought in through a different entrance to the one used on Friday, mostly escaping the glare of international publicity. His family, including sister Aimee who was looking composed in the fray, and  a cousin, were among the first to push through the throng at the security scanners. Steenkamp, a model and law graduate, was shot dead at Pistorius's home in Silver Woods country estate in Pretoria last Thursday. Her funeral takes place in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. Her body was flown down to the coastal town for a private family ceremony. Steenkamp reportedly started dating Pistorius at the end of last year, the two being photographed at local red carpet events. A campaign on facebook was doing the rounds with pictures of Steenkamp circulating, urging people to \"like\" the pictures in her memory. At the Pretoria Magistrate's Court, people with court business unassociated with double amputee medal winner Pistorius were allowed through first, and the media, desperate for one of the 25 places set aside for them, sprinted to the court room once through the security check. Other people expected are representatives of the Commission for Gender Equality who said on Monday they would be monitoring the case. During his emotional first court appearance, Pistorius heard that the State intended arguing a case of pre-meditated murder against him. On Friday, the court heard that the bail proceedings would be taken up with argument on whether the crime he is charged with falls under sections five or six of the Criminal Procedure Act. If it is the latter, his lawyer Barry Roux has to show exceptional circumstances for him to be released on bail. Sapa \/aa\/mv\/jm\/jje\/fg\/ks","label":0}

After Boeing's board of directors met for two days in Chicago, the company scheduled a 2 p.m. local time (2200 GMT) meeting with company executives and the 7E7 Dreamliner team Tuesday to announce the decision at a year-end celebration in Seattle. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, without citing any source, said Boeing had picked Everett, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Seattle, for 7E7 assembly work over Kinston, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher would not comment on the newspaper  report. The midsize, 210-passenger jet couldn't be formally launched until mid-2004, or even enter the market before 2008. But a board decision to begin offering it for sale would be an important landmark for a company that has been overtaken by Airbus in the airplane-manufacturing business it had long ruled. Boeing had not approved any all-new airplane program since the 777 in 1990. Pressure to commit to the 7E7 had grown since the aerospace giant pulled away from launching the 747X and the Sonic Cruiser in the past three years, while Airbus was pulling even in the commercial airplane market. The 7E7 is proposed as a super-fuel-efficient jet to replace Boeing's 757s and 767s with greater range to handle long-distance routes. Made with extensive use of lighter composite materials instead of metal, the airliner would use 20 percent less fuel than other airplanes. Analysts said Boeing can ill afford to turn its back on yet another new plane - especially one that seems to have solid market potential. New CEO Harry Stonecipher strongly endorsed the building  of the 7E7 on his first day in the top post this month. Japan Airlines, reportedly a potential launch customer for the 7E7, remains undecided, a spokesman said. Boeing made presentations to the airline this fall, and \"we have  been making our own internal study as we will eventually need replacements for our older Boeing 767 aircraft and Airbus A300 types,\" JAL spokesman Geoffrey Tudor said in Tokyo. \"We have made no decision or commitment on the 7E7.\" Boeing has been battered by bad news since its move to Chicago in 2001, from the post-Sept. 11, 2001, drop-off in commercial aviation to a series of defense-contracting scandals to the recent departures of chief financial officer Mike Sears (fired) and CEO Phil Condit (resigned).

Southern Free State police spokesman Captain Elsa Gerber said the robbery took place at lunchtime in the Checkers Hyper Centre. It would seem no one noticed the armed men enter the shop and were confused just how many people were involved in the incident. Gerber said reports suggested three or four men took part in the  heist and that they had a shotgun and a duffel bag to hold the cash. At least two of the men made their way to the office where the shop's safe was kept. When a Fidelity Guard member arrived to collect cash he, and an employee, were forced to open the safe. The  robbers stuffed R152,000 into the duffel bag. A cellphone representative who inadvertently stumbled onto the scene had his mobile phone and car keys taken from him. The robbers then tied up the victims with shoelaces, took the shop keys from the manager and made a getaway through the back door.

Alaska's seafood industry contributed $4.6 billion to the state's economic output, according to a 2011 report by the Marine Conservation Alliance. In 2009, Alaska exported $1.6 billion worth of seafood to Japan, China, South Korea, Canada, and Europe. According to a report issued by the Senate committee on the impacts of the 2013 shutdown, \"a delay of even one week in the fishing season could mean that the opportunity to export to the holiday market in Asia would be missed, and Japan is the fleet's largest buyer.\" Colburn said missing the holiday market would cut into his revenue by as much as 25 percent. \"Market watchers are already noticing uncertainty in the Japanese trade press over the Alaskan supply,\" said Colburn, who remarked that this is the first time in 28 years he has not been on the Bering Sea at this point in October. Colburn added that Alaskan operations are scientifically managed to prevent overfishing, unlike Russia's. \"The Russian king crab fishery is unsustainably managed and subject to a significant amount of pirate fishing,\" he said. \"This pirate fishing has already cost the Alaskan crab fleet an estimated $500 million since 2000. If this shutdown continues that amount will only increase.\" The people who issue fishing quotas from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been sent home on unpaid leave as part of the government shutdown that began October 1. If his and other boats in the Alaskan fleet cannot get off the docks and start fishing as planned October 15, high prices may hit world markets and the US fishing industry could lose millions of dollars, he said. While the fishing boats are privately run, they depend on government-issued permits and quotas as well as federal observers, Colburn said. The Alaskan king crab season is only about two months long, but drives \"hundreds of millions in economic activity and provides thousands of jobs,\" Colburn said. \"I'm a small businessman, in a big ocean, with big bills. And I need to go fishing.\" Sapa-AFP \/mm","label":0}

Protesters pushed through police barriers in an attempt to enter the buildings, but to no avail. Its security doors remained closed. Calling for the resignations of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and  her director general Bobby Soobrayan, protesters sang songs calling for them to  \"voertsek scram\" and \"hamba go\". They also wielded placards reading: \"Angie doesn't know anything\", and \"Away  with declaring education an essential service\". One protester shouted: \"This can be another Marikana. We don't care.\" While tourists visiting the Union Buildings used cameras and cellphones to photograph the protest, the vendors outside packed up their wares. A police helicopter hovered over the crowd. The protesters soon moved away from the buildings and back to the lawns. Earlier, Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Sidumo Dlamini said structural deficiencies in the South African education system had to be urgently addressed. Cosatu supported the calls for the resignations of Motshekga and Soobrayan, he told reporters earlier. \"The protest is out of concern by Sadtu that our education in this country needs a lot of fixing,\" said Dlamini. \"There is no time for pussy-footing. We have to deal with the mud schools in  the rural areas and the low wages. \"We have to deal with the system. It is a structural apartheid system that still exists in our education system. It has denigrated the African child to the periphery,\" he said. Cosatu hoped government would \"get to its knees and speak to Sadtu\". Sadtu expected about 25,000 of its members to take part in the Pretoria march and another to Parliament, in Cape Town on Wednesday. \"The marches are meant to increase the pressure on... Motshekga and... Soobrayan to resign from their... positions, in defence of collective bargaining and promotion of quality public education,\" Sadtu said in a statement.

Investors will be watcing quarterly results from leading US corporations such as Apple, Intel, Motorola and Microsoft after several disappointments so far in the US reporting season.  In the backdrop, the market will have to monitor how record oil prices develop amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and concerns the conflict could spread. For the week to July 14, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index declined 462.37 points or 3.02 percent to 14,845.24. The broader TOPIX index of all first-section shares lost 51.44 points or 3.27 percent to 1,521.71. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) on Friday ended over five years of zero interest rates in a watershed decision for the world's number two economy after a long struggle with deflation. The unanimous decision to raise the key overnight call rate target by a quarter point to 0.25 percent was widely expected and did not surprise the market. \"Although the BoJ event is over, there is still uncertainty over  external factors. Investors will find it difficult to take large positions,\" said Kazuhiro Takahashi, equity general manager at Daiwa Securities SMBC. Investors are looking ahead to US producer and consumer price indices and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress scheduled for next week. The market is awaiting further guidance about whether the Federal Reserve will continue hiking US interest rates, which have been increased 17 straight times to 5.25 percent. \"If there are hawkish comments from Bernanke, the Nikkei-225 is likely to be pushed down to the 14,700 point level,\" Takahashi said. \"On the contrary, if the inflation data is stable and the US rate hike speculation in August calms down, share prices are expected to head toward the 15,500 points level,\" he said. He added that the higher oil prices and rising tensions in the Middle East would weigh on investor sentiment. Hiroaki Hiwada, strategist at Toyo Securities, said that market participants will be tracking US earnings results next week. \"The key is how the US high-tech sector's earnings will affect the domestic high-tech sector,\" he said. \"I don't think share prices will plunge because the economy is steady although the market needs to see the US economic news next week,\" he added.

The sarugby.co.za website reports that the victory lifts the Cavaliers up to second on the log with 15 points while the Leopards are languishing third-from-bottom with just six points from four matches as the visitors ran in six tries to the five of their hosts. Boland raced into a 14-point lead within the first eight minutes of the match as they ran in two converted tries through flyhalf Theuns Kotze and right wing Sergio Torrens with Kotze being spot on with the boot. The hosts recovered quickly and ran in their first unconverted try three minutes later through their captain and Number 8 Jeandre Rudolph before Kotze restored a 12-point lead with a penalty 12 minutes before the break. The Leopards never gave up, pressing the visitors hard which resulted in a converted try though outside centre Johan Deysel which flyhalf Schalk Hugo converted. With the hosts just five points off the pace and the first half coming to a close, the Cavaliers gave themselves a cushion when Torrens ran in for his second five-pointer of the afternoon. Kotze converted to hand the Cavaliers a handy 12-point lead at the break. The second stanza followed the same script as the first with the Cavaliers racing away into the distance as the centre-pairing of Ryan Nell and Christopher Bosch both burst over the tryline for converted tries that left the hosts 26 points adrift. With just 10 minutes left on the stadium clock, Deysel cut inside and burst through the defence to score his second try of the afternoon and with replacement flyhalf Benhard Janse van Rensburg converting, the Leopards felt they had some belief of pulling this game out of the fire. That was enhanced just two minutes later as fullback Gene Williemse crossed the line in the corner but Janse van Rensburg was unable to convert, leaving the Leopards still 14 points off the pace. Replacement utility back, Edwin Sass then rubbed salt into the wounds of the hapless Leopards as he crossed over for an unconverted try to all but seal the game with just six minutes left. But the Leopards managed to round off another poor afternoon with a consolation try through their captain, Rudolph with Janse van Rensburg knocking the ball between the sticks.

(AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton said Friday that Donald Trump has \"lowered the bar\" with regard to keeping the peace at his rallies and creating an environment that encourages dialogue. The likely Democratic nominee for president said in an interview with CNN that the presumptive Republican nominee has \"set a very bad example\" for not condemning the violence that is increasingly associated with his rallies, whether by his own supporters or his opponents. We must \"condemn all violence in the political arena,\" Clinton said. \"I don't think any of this helps anybody.\" Clinton once again hit Trump for the controversy surrounding his now-defunct Trump University, a real estate education program that some participants said made fraudulent promises, saying that the New York real estate mogul \"preyed on people.\" He \"has taken them by asking them to max out their credit cards, to appoint financial despair and walked away. So I will let the lawsuits go on,\" Clinton said. Trump University is the target of two lawsuits in San Diego and one in New York that accuse the business of fleecing students with unfulfilled promises to teach secrets of success in real estate. Trump has maintained that customers were overwhelmingly satisfied with the offerings. During a rally in Westminster, Calif., Friday, Clinton attacked Trump for saying the federal judge presiding over a case has a conflict of interest because he is \"of Mexican heritage.\" \"The judge is doing his job. That's what he got appointed to do,\" Clinton said \"And Donald Trump wants to change the subject like he does all the time. So instead of facing up to the facts that are coming out...he wants to change the subject and he is attacking a distinguished jurist.\" Clinton also joked that if Trump got into the White House, \"he's going to Trump you!\" Just 70 delegates shy of clinching the Democratic nomination, Clinton now leads rival Bernie Sanders by 268 pledged delegates and her advantage grows with the superdelegates, party officials who can back any candidate. Both Clinton and Sanders are campaigning aggressively in California, which is among the states voting on Tuesday. Sanders also dug into Trump's views on climate change during a rally in Fairfield, California, where temperatures soared past 95 degrees in a state dealing with drought. \"When he was not going bankrupt, he was spending his time studying climate change,\" Sanders said, adding that Trump \"concluded climate change is a hoax.\" Hoping for an upset in California, the Vermont senator pointed to a litany of differences with Clinton over his support for a tax on carbon to curb climate change, her use of super PACs and their conflicting votes on the Iraq war. Sanders has promoted raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour, while Clinton has supported a Senate bill to raise it to $12 an hour while encouraging cities and other communities to go higher. \"Hillary Clinton thinks 12 bucks is enough. I don't,\" Sanders said on the campus of Solano Community College. Campaigning in California on Friday at an organizing event geared at women, Clinton told about 500 cheering supporters that \"if all goes well, I will have the great honor as of Tuesday to be the Democratic nominee for president.\" Flanked by female celebrities and elected officials, including Sally Field, Elizabeth Banks and Debra Messing, Clinton embraced the historic nature of her candidacy. \"Starting next Tuesday we're on our way to breaking the highest and hardest glass ceiling,\" she said. Clinton continued her attacks on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who she assailed in a foreign policy speech this week, calling him \"temperamentally unfit\" to be president. Clinton's star supporters rallied the crowd by talking up her record of experience and questioning Trump's ability to serve. Field drew applause as she questioned why \"likeability\" is considered a problem for Clinton. \"What is this, a high school popularity contest? She's not running to be anybody's friend. She's running to be the president of the United States,\" Field said. __ Associated Press writer Ken Thomas in Fairfield, California, contributed to this report.","label":1}

One of the suicide bombers who later died in the Brussels attacks is reported to have rented the Forest apartment. The new charge could free the way for Abdeslam to be extradited to France for prosecution over the Paris attacks. His lawyer had earlier this month said that a police interrogation over the March 15 incident still had to be carried out beforehand. Abdeslam is believed to have planned to carry out a suicide bombing at the Stade de France football stadium during the Paris attacks, but to then have backed out. His brother was one of the suicide bombers who died in the attacks, which left 130 people dead. Also on Thursday, a Belgian court extended the detention of another man linked to the Paris attacks by one month, prosecutors said. The 34-year-old Belgian, identified only as Abid A, has been charged with participating in the activities of a terrorist group and harbouring a criminal. He was arrested together with Abdeslam on March 18, along with two other members of his family, which prosecutors say had hosted Abdeslam while he hid out in the Brussels neighbourhood of Molenbeek. # Notebook * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Alexandra Mayer-Hohdahl - Editing by: Rachel More, +49 30 2852 31472, dpa amh rmo","label":1}

The unruly group of IFP members blockaded the entrance of a fishery firm at Dokodweni where Comrade Zuma was to address about 300 workers. Police removed them and the scheduled interaction with  workers proceeded thereafter. The door-to-door programme went fairly well since the reception by residents was (on the contrary) very good. On the next stop which was a local sportsfield, again the ANC entourage found the venue occupied by the IFP members. The ANC avoided confrontation which was clearly being provoked.  ANC Deputy President Zuma and campaigners then proceeded to Sundumbili township at Mandeni where hundreds of teachers were holding a meeting. IFP hotheads at the township entrance tried again to barricade the road and were removed by the police. What was interesting was that on the other side of the road, scores of residents were again ululating and chanting ANC !! ANC!! as part of  welcoming the leadership and campaigners of the organization.  The IFP unruly misbehaviour indicate a deep frustration of a party that wants to disrupt everything because of its dashed hopes of winning elections tomorrow. The fact that ordinary residents of these areas warmly and excitedly welcomed the ANC campaigners, is a  clear vote of confidence on the ANC. Generally people of KwaZulu-Natal want peace and development and that is why the IFP's insanity is not getting any support from the locals in these areas.  Issued by the ANC Communications Dept.

By James S Sutterlin  The election of South Africa for a two year term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council beginning in January of this year was warmly welcomed by all members of the United Nations (UN). South Africa did not have to campaign, as many aspiring countries do. There was no other contender for the seat. This is the first time South Africa has served on the council in the 56 years since it signed the UN Charter in San Francisco, and became a founding member of the UN.   South Africa had already been welcomed back to full participation in the General Assembly and all the programmes and agencies of the UN with the end of the apartheid regime. And Dumisano Kumalo, the well-known and popular South African ambassador, was no stranger in the halls of the UN, having served as South African Permanent Representative for eight years. But membership in the Security Council was the culmination of the integration of a free South Africa as an honoured member of the world community. Given South Africa's long struggle for freedom and  human rights (for which it had enjoyed strong UN support), there was wide interest in the role South Africa would play in a council deeply involved in internal conflicts There was also awareness of South Africa's well-trained military and police forces, and its economic strength, which were already having considerable positive impact on the African continent.   What does non-permanent Security Council membership have to offer? Some UN experts have concluded that it offers few rewards. A well-researched analytical study done at Yale a few years ago concluded that non-permanent members have almost zero power; that power to take or prevent action lies exclusively with the five veto-wielding permanent members - China, France, Russia, the United  Kingdom and the United States. Yet from the first session of the Security Council, countries have found it in their interest to gain  non-permanent membership; and many devote an impressive amount of time and resources to gain the goal (and ambassadors have been fired, when they failed). Ambassador Kumalo, in a recent interview with the author (after serving in March as president of the council) said that South Africa has already found it distinctly worthwhile. The reason lies first, perhaps, in the status that comes from being a member of the council, and being in the know - if not control - of what is going on in the confidential council consultations, where most decisions are negotiated and from which non-members are excluded. All council members are included in the monthly lunches, where current issues can be informally discussed with the Secretary-General and with the other council members, including the Permanent Five.   Beyond this kind of satisfaction that comes from membership (Ronald Reagan once compared it to a country club), there is a \"soft\" power that is not subject to academic factor analysis that some states - not all -can gain from elected membership in the council. First there is the power of persuasion. An articulate and persistent ambassador - as South Africa presently has -- can be sure that what he or she states in the council will be reported to governments and may, just may, have some impact. Moreover, membership in the council brings greater media interest, so that a member can more easily gain public understanding of the reasons why  a government favours or opposes action or non-action by the council  on a particular issue. Ambassador Kumalo found that as president of  the Security Council he had a valuable \"bully pulpit\", which permitted him to get South Africa's position forcefully across to the media and the public, as well as to other member states.

Cash-strapped Zimbabwe has approached the United Nations for help with financing the general elections which are due later this year, on a date which has yet to be fixed. For the UN to consider the request, it was invited to undertake an assessment mission to the country. But the main political rivals in the country's uneasy power sharing government have reached a deadlock on how far to allow the UN panel to go. \"The UN team wants unlimited access but some of our colleagues feel it should be limited to meetings with the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, the registrar-general's office, ambassadors and political parties,\" Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said, referring to President Robert Mugabe's camp. \"There is no consensus on that. We have different views,\" Tsvangirai told reporters in Harare after holding talks with Mugabe, his longtime political rival. Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa from Mugabe's party and Finance Minister Tendai Biti, a member of Tsvangirai's party, have been tasked with looking for external funding for the vote. Tsvangirai could only express \"hope the two ministers will convince the mission to proceed.\" Biti on Monday said the country was in need of $132 million (100 million euro) for the polls which Mugabe's party wants held as early as June. He said there was no money in the national coffers for the vote. Apart from seeking foreign funding, the government would also try to raise funds on the domestic front. Biti said Zimbabwe had to raise enough money or risk the credibility of the vote. Sapa-AFP \/mr\/ks","label":0}

WEBER For months, Delta Air Lines Inc. insisted its pilots concede to {dollar}325 million (?272.5 million) in pay and benefit cuts, and the company asked a bankruptcy court judge to help it impose its will. The union voted last week to ask its members to authorize a strike, but Delta refused to budge. Then, suddenly, the two sides late Sunday inked a tentative deal on temporary pay cuts worth more  than {dollar}152 million (?127.5 million) a year, less than half what the nation's No. 3 carrier wanted. While experts say Delta may ultimately get what it wants, for now it appears the airline's pilots have a victory that has been a rarity at other major carriers who have used the bankruptcy court's  big stick to meet their goals. \"The pilots came out on top of this skirmish, but I've been around for a long time and I know who is going to win the war - Delta,\" said Minneapolis airline expert Terry Trippler, who runs travel Web site cheapseats.com. United Airlines, a unit of Elk Grove Village, Illinois-based UAL  Corp., has used the leverage of federal bankruptcy law to extract not one but two rounds of hefty wage and benefit cuts from employees during its restructuring. It also succeeded in dumping their defined-benefit pension plans, replacing them with much less costly plans. During three years in Chapter 11, a judge has sided with the nation's No. 2 carrier in almost every one of its labor-related requests. At Eagan, Minnesota-based Northwest Airlines Corp., pilots, flight attendants and ground workers are all working under temporary cuts, won under the No. 4 U.S. carrier's threat that a bankruptcy judge might allow it to impose even harsher terms. That could still happen. Northwest is set to ask for permission on Jan. 17 to reject those union contracts, which would allow it to impose whatever terms it wants. All three groups have said they will try to make a deal with Northwest before then. At Atlanta-based Delta, the pilots held their ground, longer than some experts thought they would. They held a rally that gathered more than 800 pilots and their wives to protest the company's effort to void the union contract. The union formed a strike preparedness committee, threatened repeatedly to strike if the contract was thrown out and ultimately voted to seek a strike authorization from members. The tentative agreement, which followed meetings between the sides over the weekend brokered by United States Trustee Deirdre Martini in New York, includes a 14 percent across-the-board wage cut for pilots and reductions in other pilot pay and cost items equal to an additional 1 percent hourly wage reduction. Based on the pilots' average annual salary of {dollar}169,393 (?142,048), the cuts would save Delta {dollar}152.5 million (?128 million) on an annual basis. \"The other airlines have not been making significant compromises,\" said New York airline bankruptcy lawyer William Rochelle. \"United Airlines certainly didn't. It's hard to imagine that Delta would cave, but who knows?\" Delta spokesman John Kennedy noted that the agreement is only an  interim one, and management will still seek a more comprehensive deal by March, but he acknowledged that even the company felt the need for give and take. \"Did they win the battle?\" Kennedy asked. \"The answer is this symbolizes the Delta spirit of people working together to resolve situations to save the company.\" He said if there are any winners with the temporary pact, it is the traveling public. \"This is good news for Delta's customers as they can have full confidence that Delta will operate a full schedule without interruption throughout the holiday season,\" Kennedy said. Down the road, Delta could still get all of the concessions it wants from its pilots, said airline analyst Ray Neidl, who added that he believes it was the union not the company that saw the writing on the wall. \"They came to reality,\" Neidl said of the pilots. \"They're going  to negotiate the cuts that the company needs. It would have been suicidal for them to go on stri","label":1}

The synod of the Protestant Church in the Rhineland region was meeting in the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler near Bonn and it had required a two-thirds majority of the over 200 members eligible to vote. Same-sex couples may now marry in the Rhineland's Protestant churches and enter their marriages in the church registry. Previously, the church had only blessed same-sex unions. Those couples may now enter their unions retroactively in the church registry. Germany's official Protestant Church (EKD) is divided into regional churches by federal state. There is no unified position on same-sex marriage in Germany. The Protestant Church in the state of Hesse has registered same-sex marriages for a long time, while in Berlin-Brandenburg they plan to introduce them in the spring. In the majority of the 20 states the Protestant Church blesses same-sex unions, but does not offer wedding ceremonies. The Rhineland church has a reputation for being liberal. Even before Friday's vote to allow registered same-sex weddings, the church introduced \"church service accompaniment\" to same-sex blessings in the year 2000.

Unhappy that the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) had last  week signed a memorandum with Agri-SA and the African National Farmers Union (NAFU) to allow electioneering on farms, TAU said it would prevent political parties and the IEC from entering their property during the working week. \"No other organisation would allow work to be interrupted, why should farmers?\" argued TAU president Paul van der Walt. This follows the signing of an accord promoting the right of farm workers to vote. A memorandum of understanding to this effect was signed by Agri-SA, Nafu, farm workers' unions and the Independent Electoral Commission last Friday in Pretoria. It binds farmers to allowing IEC officials reasonable access to their property, and provides for workers to attend political rallies. Represented farmers also undertook to give their workers time off to vote.  On the other hand, the accord seeks to address the safety and security concerns of farmers by prohibiting unannounced visits by electoral staff or political party representatives. Chief electoral officer Pansy Tlakula said the signing was the culmination of a series of discussions that started last September.  The accord had been modified numerous times. A key challenge, she said, was balancing the right of access to voters with farmers' concerns for their safety TAU said it would not recognise the accord as it had not been party to its signing. \"The attendance of public meetings in public facilities is a personal decision. However, permission to set foot on private property remains the land owner's right and can not by signed away by anyone,\" Van der Walt said. He said there was plenty of time after work for the different parties to interact with the workers and there were lots of public places like schools to do it at. He argued many working days would be lost if all the parties contesting the elections wanted time with the farm workers. \"If you let some parties in and not others you are accused of bias,\" he said, stating that it had been decided to stop any group from entering a farm during working days.

A German newspaper report due out on Wednesday suggested meanwhile that funds for the A350 expected from Berlin might be held up pending the resolution  of questions about work on the plane and future projects to be done in Germany. Airbus has become a symbol of European excellence and shows that \"France and  Europe can succeed in international competition,\" French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at the ceremony that opened the 74,000 square-metre (800,000 square-foot) facility outside the southwestern city of Toulouse. The A350XWB (extra wide body), which Airbus expects to begin delivering in 2014, will \"allow us to capture fifty percent of the long-haul aircraft market,\" forecast the company's chief executive Fabrice Bregier. Airbus has dethroned Boeing in the medium-haul segment, but the American manufacturer still dominates the long-range market with its 747, 777 and new 787 Dreamliner. The A350XWB will complete Airbus' long-haul stable, which includes the A380 super jumbo and the A330. Originally based on the two-engine A330, the A350XWB will make extensive use  of composite materials to lower weight and deliver fuel economy, much like Boeing's 787. More than half of the Airbus aircraft will be made of composite materials. The A350XWB will be somewhat larger than its competitor, and carry up to 350  passengers whereas the 787 can transport up to 290 people. Ayrault also took the opportunity to praise the strategy of Airbus' parent company EADS, despite the collapse of its plans to merge with British defence manufacturer BAE Systems. The French prime minister told EADS chief Tom Enders, who is German: \"I have  complete confidence in the strategy of the group you lead, and I wish you good luck and success in all the projects you undertake.\" The BAE tie-up, which would have created the top aerospace and defence company and given EADS the prospect of better access to the US market, was scuttled by Germany earlier this month due to fears the country might lose manufacturing sites. It was a clear example of tension in relations between Germany and France, the two biggest eurozone economies. The German daily Handelsblatt said in its edition to appear on Wednesday that Berlin had rejected calls by Ayrault for Germany to respect its financial commitments to the A350 programme, pending agreement on issues related to manufacturing and research jobs. \"For reasons of budgetary law, this financial commitment is accompanied by clear expectations,\" the newspaper quoted a German finance ministry source as saying. \"The Airbus company must respect its commitment and reinforce and expand production, research and development in German plants in the current and future  programmes,\" the source added. The German government has frozen the payment of an instalment of aid for the  A350 worth 600 million euros ($778 million), from a total of 1.1 billion euros,  while Britain and France have each put 1.1 billion euros at Airbus' disposal for the programme, Handelsblatt reported last week. Ayrault said on Tuesday that it was \"essential that commitments were fully respected,\" before adding: \"France, for its part, will respect its own.\" Sapa-AFP \/sdv","label":0}

Shares are expected to be priced at between 260 pence and 330 pence, giving a market valuation of between 2.6 billion pounds and 3.3 billion pounds. Based on these figures, the government will raise between 1.04 billion pounds and 1.72 billion pounds. The sale is a big and controversial change for a national institution that dates to the time of King Henry VIII. Even Margaret Thatcher, who championed the sale of state-owned companies such as British Telecom and British Gas in her tenure as prime minister, refrained from privatizing Royal Mail in the 1980s. Business minister Michael Fallon was reminded in a BBC interview of Thatcher's reticence. The late leader had famously said she was not prepared to  privatize Queen Elizabeth II's head - an image which appears on stamps across the land. \"We are not selling the queen's head,\" Fallon said. \"We are not selling the post offices. We are selling Royal Mail.\" The stock sale would allow Royal Mail to tap investment it needs to modernize and to compete, particularly in parcel delivery, a major source of income as letter use declines in favor of email. But postal unions and the government opposition have condemned the initial public offering as a \"fire sale\" of a lucrative state asset. Stock trading starts on Oct. 15 - a day before the Communications Workers Union strike ballot  closes. Union workers stand to benefit from the stock sale, with 10 percent of the shares made available for free to 150,000 U.K.-based Royal Mail employees. But there are fears of potential job losses. \"Those who want to sell off the Royal Mail Group are motivated purely by short-term gain and vested interests,\" the postal union told its members in a statement. \"We cannot give the company a free hand to determine your future and  the future of U.K. postal services.\" The sale will close on Oct. 8, with the actual pricing expected to be announced on Oct. 11.

On Monday, about 1,000 people, including children, left the muddy, overcrowded makeshift camp at the border crossing of Idomeni and entered FYROM through an unfenced and unguarded dangerous stream five km further. Referring to Monday's incident, Tsipras made a fresh appeal to the more than 12,000 people who have remained in Idomeni for weeks after the gradual borders closures along the Balkan route to central Europe. He advised them to agree to be transferred to hosting facilities in order to receive adequate aid from the Greek state before their relocation to other European countries under an EU program launched last year. However, most of the refugees insist on staying close to the border in the hope that it may reopen soon. Many believe that EU leaders gathering in Brussels on March 17 to 18 may reach a decision for the overnight lifting of restrictions, refugees at the Idomeni tent city told Xinhua on Tuesday. Others have started to realize that the borders will most likely remain closed and are considering the relocation option. \"Interest in the relocation program is certainly picking up as people come to realize that this might be a good solution for them,\" Babar Baloch, the UNHCR head in Idomeni told Xinhua on Tuesday. \"The borders will not open again soon,\" the Greek leader underlined on Tuesday, suggesting refugees ignore the rumors and \"criminals\" misinforming and encouraging them to risk their lives to cross rivers illegally to enter FYROM only to be sent back to Greece. Tsipras pointed to leaflets distributed at Idomeni during the weekend urging refugees to cross into FYROM from a swelling stream near Chamilo village. Greek police are conducting an investigation to trace the individuals or group responsible for the pamphlet. According to police sources, Greek authorities suspect smugglers or \"irresponsible people who pose as volunteers.\" Some 40 volunteers along with 30 photo journalists were detained by FYROM authorities on Monday after crossing the stream alongside the refugees. While most of them have been released after paying a 260-euro (289 U.S. dollar) fine, according to the Greek side. However, it was still unclear on Tuesday afternoon where the refugees who crossed into FYROM ended up. Greek state officials have not confirmed media reports that hundreds of refugees have been sent back to Greece by FYROM authorities informally through similar unfenced border crossings over the past few hours. Athens is still waiting for Skopje to submit a formal request for the return of the refugees Yorgos Kyritsis, the spokesman of Greece's Refugees Crisis Management Mechanism body told Greek MEGA television channel on Tuesday. \"We cannot confirm nor deny whether they have been returned,\" deputy defense minister Dimitris Vitsas told local SKAI radio. During a visit to Idomeni on Tuesday, European Commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, reaffirmed \"EU's solidarity and support to Greece in coping with the refugee crisis and the resulting humanitarian crisis.\" The unacceptable living conditions at Idomeni where refugees sleep in rain-soaked tents, relying on aid provided by NGOs for food and medical care must stop, he said.

Secretary General Kofi Annan  is no longer valid following reports that Annan might use the visit  to press President Robert Mugabe to step down after more than two decades in power. \"Zimbabwe is not a U.N. issue,\" Mugabe spokesman George Charamba  was quoted as saying in state media Thursday, a day after the leaders of Britain and South Africa said Annan's intervention was the best chance for solving Zimbabwe's economic and political crisis. Following talks in London with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, South African President Thabo Mbeki told reporters Annan had  indicated in talks with him earlier this year that he would travel to Zimbabwe for direct talks with Mugabe and was expected to propose a package of aid in return for an assurance that Mugabe would hand over leadership. Neither he nor Blair would elaborate. Mugabe has led Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. In New York, U.N. Undersecretary-General Ibrahim Gambari said the United Nations has not received \"any official word from the government\" of Zimbabwe that the invitation has been withdrawn. \"There is no action ... on our part of the U.N. on the issue of the stepping down of President Mugabe,\" Gambari said in an interview with AP Television News. Annan had said last year that he would visit Zimbabwe at Mugabe's invitation. But no date has been set and U.N. officials have indicated planning the agenda and goals of such a visit is sensitive and difficult. Charamba said Mugabe had invited Annan to see for himself the outcome of a slum clearance operation that U.N. humanitarian officials condemned, estimating that at least 700,000 people were left homeless or without livelihoods in the impoverished nation in May and June, 2005. Gambari, who heads the political affairs department at the U.N.,  said he is working with Zimbabwe's foreign minister \"on how best to  prepare for a positive visit by the secretary-general to Zimbabwe which would help advance this process of helping the people of Zimbabwe because they are the ones suffering the most now.\" \"What we are doing under the leadership and very active role of the secretary-general is to engage with the government of Zimbabwe to address the humanitarian challenges, the economic situation which is quite difficult,\" Gambari said. Next week, he said, the U.N. resident coordinator in Zimbabwe will be coming to New York to discuss what is happening on the ground and what can be done to help. Charamba said the slum clearance operation had been followed by a rehousing program for the displaced \"thereby removing the purpose  of the invitation,\" and making it \"stale\" and \"fall away.\" \"That is known to the U.N. The situation has changed,\" he said. Mbeki has called for constructive engagement with Zimbabwe, while Blair has been a harsh and outspoken critic of Mugabe. Charamba said Britain and the United States were trying to use the U.N. to further what he called their own \"narrow foreign policy  goals.\" Western development aid, investment and loans have dried up in political and economic turmoil following Mugabe's campaign, begun in 2000, to seize farms from whites and transfer the land to blacks. Zimbabwe's once healthy, agriculture-based economy has collapsed since the seizures began and Mugabe has grown increasingly autocratic. Western nations, protesting a break down in law and order, sweeping media and security curbs and deteriorating democratic and human rights, have demanded reforms that analysts said were unlikely unless Mugabe left office. The government insisted last year's so-called urban renewal drive known as Operation Murambatsvina - or Clean Out Trash in the local Shona language - flushed out criminals and illegal black market traders whose activities were fueling record inflation.

His goals were to bolster international relations, make money for his company and help farmers, one big red beet harvesting machine at a time. Others have since joined in. John Miller, president of Miller-St. Nazianz Inc., which builds self-propelled sprayers, said his company began selling machinery in eastern Europe a little more than a year ago. The St. Nazianz, Wisconsin-based company has sold about 20 of the {dollar}150,000 (?102,000) sprayers in former Soviet states, and has orders for about a dozen more so far this year, he said. The initial sales came at a time when sales where slumping domestically, said Miller, whose company has about 170 workers. Sapa-AP","label":0}

Instead, it's straight back to the grindstone. On Tuesday the Tuks\/HPC athlete won the 100m at Athletics South Africa's Night Series meeting in 9.96sec to claim a new national record. It's only the second time that a local sprinter has run a sub-10 seconds race in South Africa and the fifth time in total if international races are also taken into account. Prinsloo also made it clear that it's too early in the season to start celebrating. \"Our goal, which is to qualify for the Olympic final in Rio, remains the same, which means that there is still a lot of hard work to be done. That is why I say it is back to the grindstone for Akani,\" Prinsloo said. Sport is all about rivalries and Saturday, at the Gauteng-North Championships at Pilditch, when Simbine (Tuks\/HPC) will face Henricho Bruintjies (Tuks) in the short sprints, may well see the beginning of a rivalry that could grip the imagination of sports fans across the country. Before Simbine 'blitzed' out of his block on Tuesday, the two of them shared the national record of 9.97. Bruintjies missed most of last year's local season because of injuries and it will be the first time in nearly a year that they race each other in a local sprint. Judging by Tuesday's performance Simbine should be the favourite, but rumour has it that Bruintjies is in good form. It's said that he is much like a 'time bomb' just waiting to explode. It should also be remembered that Bruintjies improved his time in the 60m indoor races each time he raced in Europe. He started off with 6.68 and ended with 6.62 in his last race. Prinsloo, who coaches both of them, is the proverbial man in the middle and is not prepared to stick out his neck and make predictions of who he expects to win. However, he hinted that Simbine may have a slight edge because the two of them have been working together for quite a few years while he only started coaching Bruintjies three weeks ago. \"Henricho and I are still in the process of getting used to working together. He still has to learn and understand what I expect from him as a coach, while I will have to find out what works and doesn't work for Bruintjies.\" There are those who are slightly worried about the fact that Simbine and Bruintjies will be training together. But according to Prinsloo he's fully aware of the potential pitfalls but he is confident that they can make it work. \"I made it clear to both of them that when it comes to training, I won't stand any nonsense. At the moment everything is going smoothly. I think this is because they are both driven individuals who respect each other's abilities as sprinters. \"They also know exactly what they want to achieve and they realise that their respective goals will mean they will have to face each other on the track. It is very important that they always heed the principle of what happens on the track stays on the track.\" - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

If they can't use it for the purposes intended there, because the ANC is allowing the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) to block policy implementation, well, give it to us in the Western Cape. \"We will show you in a pilot project just how outstanding this programme can  be if implemented properly and we will also show that none of the negative effects that Cosatu is predicting will come to pass.\" Zille was speaking after a briefing on a youth wage subsidy programme being introduced in her province. Economic development MEC Alan Winde said the programme, created in 2009, had  placed over 2000 first-time job seekers into a six-month work position, with about 70 percent remaining in the position full-time. The candidates had to have at least a matric or equivalent qualification and  be between 15 and 34 years old. They received a R1200 monthly stipend from the province, with many companies  opting to top this up. Winde said the programme had been so successful they were already over-subscribed. The national youth subsidy would allow the SA Revenue Service (Sars) to partially reimburse companies that paid wages to a young employee. Zille said she supported the programme. \"We fully support national treasury's version. Obviously we can't do that locally because we do not have control over Sars.\" She called on President Jacob Zuma to make a decision on the programme. \"We are saying to the president: lead this country. Are you allowing Cosatu to hold you to ransom because you want to be re-elected in Mangaung? If so, you  are letting down the youth.\" Zuma said recently that the youth wage subsidy was before the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) so it could consider all views  and make final recommendations to Cabinet. He said the challenge was to find common ground between the opposing views on the subsidy. Violence erupted on Tuesday when the Democratic Alliance showed support for the subsidy by marching to Cosatu's headquarters in Johannesburg. The DA has accused the union federation of blocking the subsidy's implementation and costing young people jobs. Cosatu maintains the subsidy will  displace existing jobs and enrich employers. DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko said she wanted Cosatu's general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi to witness the youth subsidy programme in action. \"I will today write to Vavi and urge him to come and see this success for himself so that he can base his position on evidence and not merely ideology. \"He relies on baseless arguments, such as that this policy would result in older workers losing their jobs, to justify his opposition to job creation.\" Zille said the provincial programme had not resulted in any job displacements and all employees were protected by stringent labour laws.

The government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants the Japanese company to agree to a recall that could more than double the 28.8 million Takata inflators that already must be replaced, according to the people who requested anonymity because talks are still ongoing. An announcement could come as soon as Wednesday. Unlike most air bag makers, Takata's inflators use the chemical ammonium nitrate to fill air bags in a crash. But they can explode with too much force, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 11 people have died worldwide and over 100 have been hurt by the inflators. The latest death was a 17-year-old Texas girl who got into a relatively minor crash while driving her family's 2002 Honda Civic. Neither the government nor Takata would say if more recalls are coming, but under an agreement reached with the company last year, it must prove that the inflators are safe or begin recalling them in 2018. The government wants Takata to agree to recall all inflators that don't have a drying agent called a dessicant, but the size of the recall expansion is unclear, the people said. NHTSA previously has said there are as many as 53 million unrecalled inflators on U.S. roads that don't have the drying agent, including 35 million front passenger inflators and another 18 million inflators for side air bags. There are a total of 85 million unrecalled Takata inflators in U.S. vehicles, including 32 million that have the drying agent. Such an expansion would cost Takata billions on top of what it already has spent replacing inflators, raising concerns about the company's financial health. The problem has been linked to older cars with long-term exposure to high humidity. That's why replacement parts are being targeted to areas such as the U.S. Gulf Coast, although many of the cars have been recalled nationwide. No one knows for certain how long it takes for the ammonium nitrate to deteriorate or whether inflators in older cars in cooler, less-humid states might explode in the future. That makes the safety of Takata inflators \u2014 which are in driver, passenger and side air bags \u2014 a potentially deadly unknown. NHTSA has said that no inflators have ruptured that contain the dessicant, either in tests or on the road, except for two side air bag ruptures in testing that were blamed on a separate manufacturing defect. The agency based its estimate on data provided by Takata and the 14 car and truck makers that have Takata inflators in their vehicles. Takata has agreed not to sign any more contracts to sell ammonium nitrate inflators and phase it out of manufacturing by the end of 2018. Earlier this year, scientists hired by 10 automakers blamed the trouble on a combination of volatile ammonium nitrate, heat and humidity, and inflator containers that may let moisture seep in.","label":0}

In late morning trading, London's benchmark FTSE 100 index lost 0.48 percent  to 5,682.86 points, Frankfurt's DAX 30 slid 0.98 percent to 6,677.45 points and  in Paris the CAC 40 dipped 1.15 percent to 3,232.07. Madrid's Ibex 35 index tumbled 2.13 percent to 7,359.70 points and Milan's FTSE Mib index dropped 1.43 at 14,656.90. In foreign exchange deals, the euro declined to $1.3159 from $1.3188 late in  New York on Thursday. \"European indices are weaker this morning, with Spanish and Italian markets coming under the greatest selling pressure,\" said analyst David Morrison at trading group GFT. \"Sovereign bond yields for both countries are higher, and the euro has so far failed to break back above 1.32 against the US dollar.\" He added: \"Investors were rattled by the news that Spanish bank borrowing from the European Central Bank (ECB) rose dramatically last month.\" Borrowing by Spanish banks from the ECB hit a new record in March at 227.6 billion euros ($299 billion) as they snapped up emergency cheap loans, official  data showed. The figures from Spain's central bank are a sign of weak confidence in Spain's troubled financial sector, with commercial banks turning to the ECB since they are struggling to borrow on interbank lending markets. Spanish banks have found it hard to borrow money from banks in other eurozone countries because many in Spain are heavily exposed to the real-estate  sector, which has been in a slump since a bubble burst in 2008. Italy and Spain remain in the market spotlight amid fears that the pair could be sunk by the long-running eurozone debt crisis, which has already resulted in vast EU\/IMF bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Elsewhere, Asian markets mostly rose Friday, after a strong rally on Wall Street, as dealers shrugged off news that China's economy grew at its slowest pace it almost three years in the first quarter of this year. However, the Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) data has cast a cloud over  European markets. China's keenly-awaited GDP data showed that the Asian powerhouse economy grew just 8.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the weakest since the second quarter of 2009. The export-driven economy as hurt by the ongoing troubles in its key European and US markets, while demand at home was also weak. \"China's growth grinding lower as export and domestic demand cool down has dampened the market sentiment in today's European session,\" said Anita Paluch at Gekko Global Markets. She added: \"The weakness of the second largest world's economy is compounding the fears and problems the eurozone is facing at the moment.\" Friday's figures follow a string of bad results from Beijing that many analysts fear point to a sharp slowdown, which could have huge knock-on effects  for other economies that rely on Chinese growth. Asian investors took their cue from a Wall Street surge that was driven by hopes the Federal Reserve will introduce fresh stimulus measures after a second  straight week of rising jobs claims. The mood was also lifted by news that a North Korean rocket launch, which had raised regional security tensions, had failed. Hong Kong added 1.84 percent, Shanghai won 0.35 percent and Tokyo rose 1.19 percent, while Sydney gained 0.99 percent. Sapa-AFP \/dw","label":0}

Panera works to quell rage of wrong orders By CANDICE CHOI NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Panera wants to eliminate one of the biggest scourges of eating out \u2014 bungled orders. The devil, as they say, is in the details, particularly when it comes to all the adjustments people want for the sandwiches and salads on Panera's menu. And the requested additions and subtractions are only increasing as Panera works to give people more ways to order. Panera launched a campaign almost two years ago to modernize its operations. At stores that have undergone the transformation, customers can order online, on their phones or on kiosks in stores. There are signs the technological overhaul is working. Sales in the most recent quarter rose 3.6 percent at company-owned restaurants, Panera said this week. And so far in the current quarter, sales are up 6.4 percent, which Panera says is a testament to its digital transformation. Still, the system isn't perfect. When an Associated Press reporter visited a Panera in New York City last week, a side salad arrived with quinoa, despite a request to keep it off. Here's what Blaine Hurst, Panera's chief transformation and growth officer, said about how the chain is trying to prevent errors. ____ Q: In restaurants that have undergone the transformation, you mentioned employees have to press a button on their work stations to confirm if an order was modified. A: There are two buttons, they say \"Mod\" or \"No mod.\" It also used to just say \"Bacon Turkey Bravo, add onions\" on the order screen. Now, we list the full ingredients in the sequence they're supposed to be assembled. We list the ingredients, then strike through anything that's supposed to be omitted in red. If you add something, it will be in green. And if it's a substitution, it's in yellow. Q: What other new checks are in place? A: When I hand it to that quality control person behind the counter, they ask, \"Bacon Turkey Bravo, extra onion, right?\" So there is verbal confirmation of every change. That chatter is very valuable. Nobody is intentionally making sandwiches wrong. It's just people get in a hurry. Confirmation back and forth is huge. Q: And there's another check after the order is assembled? A: The \"expediter\" on the other side of the counter is once again confirming that everything in that order is correct. They're taking the chit for that order, checking off the individual items, then putting their signature on it. Q: Do all the extra checks could slow things down? A: It actually turns out this is faster. This is Manufacturing 101. By decreasing the error rate, you actually increase the speed of the line. If you're dining in and your order gets messed up, what do you do? You walk up to the counter and say \"You guys made my salad wrong. Can you remake it?\" Now I have an order that has to go back through the lines. It messes up the flow. Q: What else are you doing? A: We're looking at what happens when something goes wrong. So if I mis-make your order, and I say, \"All right, I'll just take the onions off.\" Your experience just sucked. On the other hand, if I say, \"I am so sorry, can I remake this order? You go sit down, have a cup of coffee on me. Would you like a dessert?\" You went from pretty angry to, \"They're humans. They made a mistake but they took care of me.\" Q: So if Panera gets my order wrong, I get a free coffee? A: No, but if we get your order wrong on a Rapid Pickup order, we'll give you a free dessert. There's a sign in our cafes that say that. This is almost an incentive to get you to check your order before you leave. It's also a reminder to our associates, because we really don't want them giving away a lot of free cookies. ___ Follow Candice Choi at","label":0}

Mayor Maphetle Maphetle said the council extended its sympathy to the congregation of the NG (Moedergemeente) Church after the building was gutted by fire on Wednesday night. The church on the corner of Nelson Mandela drive and Beyers Naude road was built in the 1860s. Spokesman for the city Kaizer Mohau said Beyers Naude -- an Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist and member of the African National Congress --had been a minister of the church in his earlier years.  Mohau said the mayor would soon meet church leaders to extend his condolences and to see if the city could help in revamping the church. He said only the walls of the church were left standing. \"Everything inside was made of wood.\"  Superintendent Koos Degenaar said the cause of the fire was believed  to be an electrical fault in the ceiling. Feelings have been running high in Potchefstroom over the last few months over the renaming of street signs and proposals to rename the city to Tlokwe. Four students appeared in court on Monday for allegedly removing street signs. The accused, three women and one man, were arrested on Sunday night after they were found with street signs in their vehicle. Potchefstroom's proposed name change did not sit well with some residents who have been removing new signs and dumping them in the Vaal  River or defacing them. The outcome of a court case opposing the name change to Tlokwe is still pending. Sapa","label":1}

The major indexes opened lower and were holding around the flatline in late morning. At 1530 GMT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off a fractional 0.95 point at 10,001.08 the Nasdaq composite up 2.10 points (0.11 percent) at 1,972.09. The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index was also virtually flat, gaining 0.86 point to 1,126.26. Although crude oil fell further from its recent peaks -- off 76 cents at 51.70 dollars a barrel in New York -- traders remained prudent about the ability of the stock market to extend its recent rally. \"While there is still the possibility of some choppy action around next Tuesday's election, this two-day lift comes just as the  market is entering a strong seasonal period,\" said Alfred Goldman at AG Edwards. \"The first pullback will give more evidence as to whether this is just another rally within the ongoing trading range or the start  of a more significant move into year-end.\" Additionally, some investors feared rising rates in China may signal the beginning of the end of the surge in oil and commodity prices over the last couple of years, which had been prompted largely by China's growing demand. China's central bank said Thursday it would raise its benchmark one-year lending rate to 5.58 percent from 5.31 percent from Friday. The one-year deposit rate was hiked, also by 27 basis points, to  2.25 percent, according to the central bank statement. \"Commodity prices declined in the wake of the news because slower growth in China, should it materialize, would reduce the demand for commodities,\" said Wachovia Securities economist Jay Bryson.

ExxonMobil shares climbed 10 cents to 49.05 as the world's biggest oil company reported a 56 percent jump in net earnings, offsetting the drop in energy prices. Verizon Communications, another Dow stock, fell 46 cents to 38.94 after the telecom giant reported third-quarter net income per  share flat compared with the year earlier. Intel was among the best performing blue chip, up 31 cents at 22.31 as the tech sector continued its rebound. DreamWorks Animation, the company behind the blockbuster Shrek movies, soared 9.65 dollars, or 34.46 percent, to 37.65 dollars as it began trading on Wall Street. Delta Air Lines shares surged 75 cents or more than 15 percent to 5.69 as a cost-saving deal with pilots appeared to stave off bankruptcy for the troubled carrier. Bonds remained under pressure. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond climbed to 4.091 percent from 4.087 percent Wednesday  and that on the 30-year bond to 4.848 percent against 4.844 percent.

(AP) \u2014 A pack of lesser-known players is pursuing Jordan Spieth at the Masters, and some other big names are lurking not too far behind. Danny Lee and Shane Lowry \u2014 surprisingly tied for second two strokes behind Spieth's 6-under 66 \u2014 get a couple hours head start in Friday's second round before Spieth resumes his attack on Augusta National just before 1 p.m. World No. 1 Jason Day, who struggled on the back nine Thursday to fall six strokes behind Spieth, will be back on the course around 10 a.m. Spieth is hoping to match Arnold Palmer's record Masters streak of finishing six rounds with the lead. It won't be any easier than battling the winds at Augusta National this week. A pack of five international players is three strokes back at 69. The group includes Englishmen Paul Casey, Justin Rose and Ian Poulter, Dane Soren Kjeldsen and Spaniard Sergio Garcia. Spieth and Rose are the only major winners in the front-running group. Spieth wouldn't be at all surprised if No. 1-ranked Day rebounds strongly from his back-nine struggles. \"I've seen Jason get hot before,\" Spieth said. \"I've played with him, I want to say 75 percent of the rounds the last two months of last year's season. It's nothing new. It's nothing shocking. \"We're through one round. No matter what they finish at, they'll be through one round. Jason and Shane both have the potential to get to 7, 8, 9, 10 under.\" As he said, there are plenty of birdies, bogeys \"and everything in between\" to come. Including some before he takes the course again. \"We know how to win this golf tournament, and we believe in our process, and if the putts are dropping, then hopefully it goes our way,\" Spieth said. There are other big second-day story lines to watch, beyond even Spieth's encore round. Perhaps the two biggest: Will Tom Watson make the cut in his final Masters? How will Day rebound from Thursday's 41 on the back nine after making the turn at 5 under? \u2014The 66-year-old Watson isn't chasing a third green jacket. His stated goal is to become the oldest player to make the cut at Augusta National. His opening 74 put him in position to do just that. He opened Friday in 43rd and needs to be in the top 50 after Round 2. \"Seventy-four is not bad for old folks,\" Watson said. \u2014Day had a rough final nine holes.

David Maynier, an MP from opposition party, Democratic Alliance, said in a statement that he had received word that the AFM was investigating after requesting three regulatory bodies in Germany, Netherlands and South Africa to investigate. \"We need to know whether Deloitte Accountants B.V. turned a blind eye to accounting irregularities at Steinhoff International N.V.,\" said Maynier. \"In the end, we need to be tough on crime in the public sector, and tough on crime in the private sector, and that is why we will ensure that the accounting irregularities at Steinhoff International Holdings NV, are fully investigated both abroad and in South Africa.\" In a statement issued on the AFM website on Tuesday, it confirmed it was probing Deloitte. \"The Dutch branch of Deloitte audits since 2016 the financial statements of Steinhoff, which is seated in the Netherlands since 2015,\" the AFM statement said. \"Deloitte issued a clean opinion over the 2015-2016 Steinhoff Financial Statements. Steinhoff's management concluded on December 13, 2017 that the 2016 Financial Statements do no longer meet the requirements as per Dutch law. Following that, Deloitte withdrew its approval to use their audit opinion.\" AFM said it was critical for the adequate functioning of capital markets that auditor issued opinions that were \"free from any doubt\". - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Devereaux Morkel","label":0}

At Lonmin, workers not part of the National Union of Mineworkers had complained about a lack of information, she said. Collective bargaining agreements needed innovative approaches and to go beyond wages and living conditions. Multi-year agreements were preferred, but could be reviewed on an annual basis if warranted. Representatives of platinum companies and unions attended the meeting, held at the Chamber of Mines, and chaired by independent facilitators. Facilitator Charles Nupen said there had been a \"surprising\" degree of unanimity from unions and companies. Five issues had been identified for discussion -- industry sustainability, centralised bargaining arrangements, wages, industry stability, and socio-economic problems. Talks would start on Monday towards an industry-wide agreement. Sapa \/jn\/jje\/dd\/th","label":1}

The All Blacks Sevens made up for their Cup final loss in Dubai last weekend with a clinical display in front of a sold-out Cape Town Stadium. Two tries from HSBC Player of the Final Joe Ravouvou combined with scores from Vilimoni Koroi, Tim Mikkelson, Regan Ware and Sione Molia to help head coach Clark Laidlaw's side to victory over an Argentina side chasing their first Cup win since San Diego in 2009. \"I'm so proud of how the boys played this weekend and last weekend,\" said captain Scott Curry. \"It could have gone either way after we lost our first pool match against USA but day two is another day. \"We started fresh and really worked for each other and that's what won it for us. We'll look forward to our home tournament in Hamilton coming up soon \u2013 it's a new city and they really love their rugby there.\" Hosts South Africa were knocked out 19-12 in the Cup semi-final by New Zealand yet finished strongly in third after beating Canada 19-17 in the bronze final.

He told reporters Sunday the Tanzania route was cheaper and would not take long to be completed compared to the Kenya route. In 2013, Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda agreed to link up to the Kenyan port of Mombasa along a standard-gauge railway estimated to cost 13 billion U.S. dollars. Studies done by member states in the six-nation East African Community (EAC) showed that the Tanzanian option would cost Rwanda about 800 to 900 million U.S. dollars while the Kenyan one would go for 1 billion U.S. dollars, according to the Rwanda ministry of East African Community Affairs report. \"We opted for the route transiting to Tanzania during the construction of our railway line because the Kenyan route would be expensive and time consuming,\" said Gatete. The Dar es Salaam-Isaka-Kigali\/Keza-Musongati (DIKKM) standard gauge railway (SGR) project is expected to be completed by March 2018 and is estimated to cost three countries 5.2 billion U.S. dollars. Eng. Jules Ndenga, acting special project implementation unit coordinator at the Rwanda ministry of Infrastructure, said that Rwanda and Tanzania had already held joint technical monitoring committee meeting to fast-track the project implementation. \"We are conducting a joint development of the standard gauge railway with our counterparts from Burundi and Tanzania. We have agreed contract terms and conditions and the Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA), will procure it on behalf of the three countries,\" he added. The railway route via Tanzania will link Kigali to a port in Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. A new railway is being built from Isaka in northwestern Tanzania to Kigali, with a branch to Musongati in neighboring Burundi. The existing railway from Dar es Salaam to Isaka is being upgraded.

The former Grey High School pupil, who cannot be named until he has formally pleaded, is facing charges after an 18-year-old woman opened a case against him in December last year. The alleged incident happened after a night out in KwaMagxasi in Port Elizabeth. In summarising evidence before court on Thursday, Magistrate Una Rhodes read out statements from witnesses who had also attended the party at a flat in Central. In the hours before the alleged attack, witnesses had seen the woman kissing, hugging and fondling the athlete. They also noted that the woman had consumed alcohol and substantial amounts of cannabis. The rugby player who intends to plead not guilty to the charges at trial, alleged that the woman's motive for opening a case against him was as a result of her stealing his wallet and cellphone. He claimed that the pair did have sex, but it was consensual. The State on the other hand, claimed that the defence tried to tarnish the name of the complainant and according to the prosecution the woman could have been smoking flavoured tobacco and not dagga. Magistrate Rhodes criticised the woman for her outbursts on social media in the form of voice notes. She said that it raised serious questions in her mind, leaving room to doubt the reliability of her evidence. She also noted that there were contradictions in her statement to police and the voice notes. In her statement to police the woman claimed that she was dragged from the car they drove in and raped in the bushes, while in the voice notes she claimed that she got out of the vehicle, walked home and was attacked from behind. However, Rhodes said that it was not the role of the bail court to decide on issues of credibility and those were matters to be dealt with at trial. Rhodes said that she was able to find that exceptional circumstances existed to warrant the athlete's release on bail. \"Being a sports star is not exceptional, however the circumstances around his career amount to exceptional circumstances,\" she said. Rhodes said that rugby allowed him to be self sufficient and take care of the needs of his two-year-old son. On taking the community into consideration, she said it was disconcerting a rape of a five-year old child, in the same court building, got no attention from the public. She said that she condoned \"victims speaking out\" but it needed to be done in line with following procedure. \"Why does the community feel no outrage? Do the community only feel rage because he is a Blue Bulls rugby player?\" she asked. \"The public had protested but this court cannot be held to ransom. Seemingly the public already found him guilty but this court can't be bound by public opinion,\" said Rhodes. The rugby player is to report to the Sunnyside Police Station in Pretoria thrice a week and to have no contact with the complainant and witnesses as part of his bail conditions.

Ordinary citizens, including the elderly, have been rounded-up, searched, terrorised and abused. The doors of their homes have been  broken down and personal items such as groceries have been destroyed.  The IFP's Secretary General Reverend Musa Zondi was subjected to  the same abuse shortly before the 2009 general election. It is very  clear to us that the SAPS, at the behest of the ANC, has launched a  politically motivated attack on the people of Nongoma today, months  before the 2011 local government elections.  Nongoma, in comparison to other parts of the country, has a relatively low crime rate. It is therefore our view, that the people of Nongoma are being subjected to human rights abuses right now for nothing more than their political affiliation.  We will now longer sit back and allow the ANC to torture our people; and we will no longer allow the police to abuse their power. Not even during the heydays of apartheid did we see such gross violations of human rights. We will lodge a formal complaint with Human Rights Commission as soon as possible.  The ANC's abuse of power is now threatening our democracy and peace and stability in KwaZulu Natal.

In the cash deal, Andes Petroleum will acquire 143 million barrels of proven reserves in a contract expected to be approved by  the Ecuadorian government by year's end, the Ministry of Commerce said on its website. It translates to Andes receiving about 75,000 barrels of daily oil production as well as a 36.3 percent stake in an 500-kilometre (300 mile) Ecuadorian pipeline, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported. The purchase further reflects China's growing appetite for oil as it searches the world for energy sources to feed its booming economy. CNPC is currently closing a 4.2 billion dollar acquisition of another Canadian company, the Calgary-based PetroKazakhstan Inc. PetroKazakhstan owns extensive oil rights in Kazakhstan, a Central Asian country bordering China. CNPC had no immediate comment on the Ecuadorian deal. CNPC's joint venture partners in Andes Petroleum were not known although it has been seeking to cooperate in oil projects with Venezuelan companies. India was also reportedly interested in the Ecuadorian assets as  it and China seek supplies to feed rapidly expanding economies and satisfy their growing thirst for oil and natural gas. Earlier this month, India's Oil Natural Gas Corp lost out to CNPC in the Kazakhstan deal. Growing oil demand from India and China are often cited as reasons for rising global gas prices and reflect increasing geo-political concerns over energy security the world over. Last month, China National Overseas Oil Corporation (CNOOC), another major Chinese state-owned company, abandoned a 18.5-billion-dollar takeover bid for California firm Unocal because  of \"unprecedented political pressure\" from US lawmakers.

Thuli Madonsela will this week interface with KwaZulu-Natal residents.  The dialogue is held under the theme \"Joining hands to end maladministration  and ensure responsive service delivery: Focus on RDP houses and regulatory gaps  on the illegal conversion of panel vans into taxis.\"  The two events to be held in Tongaat and Pietermaritzburg will combine the dialogue with public hearings, where stakeholders, including the members of the  public, civil society organisations, government and the media, will be expected  to share their experiences regarding problems plaguing RDP housing and converted taxis through short presentations.   Complainants, who wish to bring other matters to the attention of the Public  Protector, will be welcome to do so provided that their matters affect a group or community.   While individual complainants, whose grievances focus on other aspects of service delivery will not be turned away, it must be noted that such complaints  will not be taken during these sessions. There will be a Public Protector stall  outside the venues, where such complaints can be lodged.  An outreach event will be held at the Hamabanathi Community Hall in Tongaat,  where the Public Protector and her team will dialogue with community members on  issues relating to RDP houses and the illegal conversion of panel vans into taxis.   This will be followed by a formal stakeholder meeting with provincial executives, government officials, political parties, civil society and experts in the areas under the spotlight at the Provincial Legislature in Pietermaritzburg.  The issues to be addressed at both events emanate from ongoing systemic investigations into RDP housing problems and regulatory gaps in the illegal conversion of panel vans into taxis. They include waiting lists, procurement concerns, quality of homes, conveyance arrangements, sale of RDP homes, allegations of corruption, regulatory framework and accountability for challenges such as safety and passenger insurance.  The campaign is also in line with the constitutional injuction that the Public Protector should be accessible to all persons and communities.

Debate on the no confidence motion which Agang proposed was scheduled to take place in the National Assembly on March 3.  \"The party took the matter to court demanding that National Assembly Speaker  Ms Baleka Mbete not preside over the debate because of her assumed partiality,\"  Parliament said in a statement.  \"Agang SA also wanted a secret ballot if the motion was put to a vote.\"  The court ruled that the application for Mbete's recusal and secret voting were semi-urgent and should be enrolled on a date and subject to a timetable determined by the judge president.\" The interdict sought against the scheduling of the debate was dismissed primarily on the grounds of separation of powers. The Constitutional Court dismissed the same application earlier this month on the basis that it was not in the interests of justice to grant direct access.

Fossett -- who has survived numerous brushes with death during a series of record-breaking solo flights around the world by balloon and airplane -- has not been heard from since taking off from a private airstrip early Monday. Since then, a squadron of planes and helicopters have flown over a 600-square-mile (155,000-hectare) region of mountain terrain looking for the 63-year-old aviator -- a task officials have compared to \"searching for a needle in a haystack.\" Rescue planes were boosted by clear skies and calm flying conditions  on Wednesday after being buffeted by turbulence during searches earlier  this week, but Fossett has yet to be found. Major Cynthia Ryan of the Civil Air Patrol revealed that high-tech hyperspectral imaging equipment known as ARCHER, which is capable of distinguishing between objects on the ground, had also been deployed. \"It's pretty sophisticated stuff ... beyond what the human eye can generally see,\" Ryan said. At one point Wednesday rescuers thought they had found Fossett's plane, only to realize that they had actually discovered debris from an  old crash site. \"We thought we had it nailed,\" Ryan said. \"Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of many dozen unmapped wreck sites from previous years.\" Fossett was reported missing on Monday after he failed to return from a solo flight in a single-engine Bellanca plane following take-off  from an airfield owned by hotel magnate Barron Hilton. His aircraft was equipped with an electronic tracking device designed to be activated in the event of a crash, but it had not been deployed. Fossett made the first solo nonstop, non-refueled circumnavigation of the world in 67 hours in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer. In 2002, he was the first person to fly solo around the world in a balloon. British tycoon Richard Branson, who partnered Fossett on earlier attempts to circle the globe in a balloon, told Canadian media he had asked Internet search giants Google to try to look at satellite images in an effort to track Fossett's flight. The British billionaire said although he was concerned at Fossett's failure to activate an emergency tracking beacon, he remained positive. \"(Steve's) not only the greatest aviator in the world, he's also the  greatest gliding pilot in the world,\" Branson said. \"I'm very confident that he would have got the plane down in one piece as long as the terrain below him was desert and not mountainous hills or woods or rocks. \"Having said that, obviously we're worried (about) the fact that there's been no emergency beacon go off. He could be injured, which means the emergency services have just got to get to him as soon as possible.\" A multi-millionaire who made his fortune dealing stocks in Chicago, Fossett has spent the past two decades chasing world records and shattering them, sailing, floating and flying faster and farther than anyone before. In 2006, he touched his aircraft down at an airfield on Britain's south coast, setting the record for the longest solo, non-stop, non-refueled flight in terms of distance. Fossett has also set dozens of world records in sailboats, gliders and hot-air balloons. \"If you look at the history of adventurers, it is so often the simple things (that cause trouble),\" Branson noted. \"Lawrence of Arabia went through everything and was then killed in a  motorbike accident when he'd given up all his dangerous pursuits in Arabia. Anyway, I still feel confident that Steve will come back.\" Sapa-AFP","label":0}

The programme has entered a critical stage of implementation. The key pillars of the rollout strategy are the scrapping of old taxi vehicles, the introduction of new and safe vehicles, effective regulations, empowerment of the taxi industry and law enforcement. This strategy recognizes that the TRP is not only about the replacement of old vehicles with new and safe vehicles, but presents Government with the opportunity to transform, empower and regulate the industry. Attempts to evaluate progress of the TRP on the basis of doubts expressed by certain vehicle manufacturers are not only mischievous and misleading to the public, but reflect lack of appreciation of both the complex nature of the TRP and the significant progress made by Government since the adoption by Cabinet of the strategy to rollout the TRP in  July 2005. Key achievements to-date is the publication of Safety Requirements in the second half of 2005, the issuing in December 2005 of a tender for the establishment of a scrapping agency and a public campaign aimed at mobilizing taxi operators to convert their  permits into operating licenses. Today, thousands more taxi operators have moved significantly with the process of converting their permits, the tender has since closed and currently being evaluated with the view to create a mechanism to scrap 10 000 of the old taxi vehicles, the NLTTA Amendment Bill is before Parliament to enable Government to implement the TRP, and most importantly, we are seeing the entry into the market of new and safe vehicles that begin to respond to the Safety Requirements published by the Minister of Transport, Mr Jeff Radebe.  Whilst some of the vehicles are not yet fully compliant, there is agreement between Government and the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Southern Africa (NAAMSA) that new vehicles will need to be compliant by 1 July 2006. This date was part of agreements reached between Government and NAAMSA lead by Minister Jeff Radebe and Dr Van Zyl respectively in mid 2005.  A large proportion of vehicles entering the market are those with bigger seating capacities of 18 to 28 (midi buses). With the addition of few safety requirements like seatbelts and driver-operated door, taxi vehicles in the midi bus category would comply with the safety requirements. The South African Bureau of Standards is currently finalizing national standards for some of the safety requirements such as rollover protectors; anti-tyre burst stabilizers and tamper proof speed governors. Once national standards have been developed in some of these areas, further regulations would be introduced to enhance the safety of vehicles. As part of the implementation of the safety requirements, the Department is pleased to announce that the SABS has on Tuesday 4th April 2006 reported that the Toyota Quantum which falls in the range of a vehicle of the lower seating range 9-16 (minibus) is capable of having the Type II braking system. This safety requirement was one of the four being investigated by the SABS, and  the Department will now proceed to introduce this safety requirement. The introduction of safety requirements is not a totally new phenomenon, as some of the vehicles especially in the midi bus category currently available in the market meet some of the key legislated requirements. However, the introduction of compliant minibuses into the market is slower than that of midi buses because  this category calls for the possible re-design of these vehicles. It is expected in the second half of the year, compliant minibuses would be available in the market.  These are targeted interventions by the Department of Transport that define the TRP. The Department's assessment of progress being made is positive and contrasts sharply with the pessimism contained  in the article by Roy","label":0}

The police argue the part of the advert where Maimane says \"the police are killing our people\" with images of a policeman shooting at a person, would \"invite violent acts against the members of the SAPS\". In terms of rules governing election advertisements, all complaints should be lodged 48 hours after the advert was initially aired. The DA said police were \"hopelessly out of time\" to lodge a complaint because the advert was originally aired on April 8 and 9. William Mokhari, for the police, told the hearings that they only became aware of the advert on April 11 and lodged a complaint on April 20. The advert was previously banned by the SABC after it was flighted on April 8 and 9. The public broadcaster said the advert incited violence. The DA laid a complaint with Icasa, after which a public hearing was held on  the matter. The DA and SABC came to an agreement on April 16 and the broadcaster aired it again.

The Johannesburg-based Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, which had been closed for renovations for nearly a year, houses a wide array of documents on the life of the anti-apartheid leader. Some of the items on display show Mandela's prison card, with the date of his arrival on Robben Island on May 27 in 1963. Also on show is a grey and tattered warrant of committal issued by the Supreme Court on November 7, 1962. \"The centre now offers the public an opportunity to view the physical documents, not just the digital images,\" said Sello Hatang, spokesman for the centre. In March 2012, the centre, with the help of Google, transformed thousands of  handwritten documents, photographs and videos of Nelson Mandela into a digital searchable online collection. The revered leader, regarded as the father of democracy in South Africa, spent 18 years in the island prison off the coast of Cape Town after he and others were found guilty of treason. He was later transferred in 1982 to Pollsmoor prison in Cape Town and later to Victor Verster prison in the nearby town of Paarl, until his release in February 1990. In 1994 he became the country's first black president, ending decades of whites-only apartheid rule. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate then served a single term in office before retiring from public life in 2004. The frail 94-year-old has been in and out of hospital recently, where he spent 10 days until April 7 being treated for pneumonia. Sapa-AFP \/sdv\/fg","label":0}
{"id":"5da6f8180d84000017827d66","url":"SAPAI-5e880a153b-12763.txt","text":"Thailand's government on Saturday indefinitely postponed its plans to privatise the nation's largest power producer in May, caving in to mounting protests from state workers. Energy Minister Prommin Lertsuridej said the listing of 25 percent of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) would be shelved to allow for consultation with unions and the creation of a new power regulator. \"The initial public offering of EGAT is postponed indefinitely and the government will not set a new deadline,\" he told reporters. \"I hope that overseas as well as local investors will understand  the situation,\" he said, referring to fears that the postponement of the country's biggest ever float will hurt confidence in Thailand's economy. The decision was a stunning reversal by the government which had  vowed to press ahead with its policy of privatising state enterprises and told protesters that they faced a crackdown if demonstrations got out of hand. Last week Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra warned that the stock market and baht currency could crash if his government abandoned its privatisation agenda, a key part of its economic platform since storming to power in 2001. But he began the climbdown earlier Saturday in his regular radio  address, taking a softer tone towards the tens of thousands of state workers who have rallied outside EGAT headquarters for the past two weeks. \"I have asked my ministers why workers have had to rally and I found out that I myself must be blamed for rushing officials to privatise and that a lack of explanation to the public has caused misunderstandings,\" he said. Thaksin said the public had gained the wrong impression that the  entire 25 percent stake would be sold to foreigners, but that in fact only about two to three percent would find its way to overseas  investors. But he insisted he was not caving in to the demonstrations, and that he would not agree to a public hearing on the privatisation issue which is one of their demands along with the removal of EGAT's chief. \"It's not about retreating or not retreating but it's a matter of clarity, fairness and the national interests, while we also have  to take staff welfare into consideration,\" he said. Prommin said the government would attempt to reverse the misunderstandings and also establish a seven-member committee to oversee electricity distribution and pricing before pushing ahead with new plans to privatise EGAT. The government has said EGAT will need to invest heavily in the future in order to keep up with the huge demand for electricity in Thailand and that if it remained a state enterprise the debt would weigh heavily on the country. But the first hiccup in the listing plans came Monday when the government announced that the first step in the process, corporatisation which would transform it into a public company, was  delayed due to legal technicalities. The ruling Thai Rak Thai party has also had to defend itself against union allegations that it would use proceeds from the privatisation to fund its campaign for national elections planned for early next year. Up to 100,000 workers at EGAT and other state firms, who fear the privatisation scheme will cost them their jobs, were expected to rally outside Government House on Tuesday in the biggest show of  opposition so far. But the unions who have mounted a fierce resistance to the plans  said they would not cancel the protest until the government guaranteed the postponement in writing. Sapa-AFP","label":1}

She had written to the Economic Freedom Fighters on January 16 requesting details of his conviction and sentencing. The party did not respond.  \"Part of the details solicited was whether or not Mr Babuile, has appealed the matter and relevant details thereto, as well as to ascertain his status and  eligibility to occupy a seat in the legislature,\" Chaane said. \"This would have assisted the legislature to take an informed decision and to act on the matter in terms of its rules and procedures.\" Dantjie sent another letter on January 26 requesting clarity.

Briefing the National Assembly's sports committee on Tuesday, Stofile said using racial quotas as a tool for achieving transformation  in sports was counter-productive. He said transformation could only be achieved by making resources available for sports development. \"The DA has over the past few years maintained that exact view -- sport -- like all areas of life -- should be an open opportunity field,  where race is not an obstacle to fulfilling your potential, where merit, excellence and dedication define your chances of success, where politics has no place and where government provides the wherewithal for  you to develop your talent and ability, rather than making your success  dependent on your race,\" Lee said. The minister, Lee said, must now take up his development and empowerment role with new commitment so that South Africa's young and budding sports stars could get the opportunities they required.  \"The DA will be submitting questions to the Minister of Sport to establish how the government intends to improve development and what it  is going to do about the infrastructure backlog,\" he said.

Motlatsi Ishmail Pitlele, 43, appeared before magistrate Sabrina Sonnenberg,  who warned him to appear in court again on August 21. Prosecutor Simone Liedeman told the court Pitlele had abandoned his application for legal aid, and that privately funded advocate C Ctiyase would conduct the defence. Pitlele was previously represented by privately funded advocate Saliem Banderker, who withdrew for financial reasons. Liedeman alleges Pitlele twice billed Legal Aid SA for work not done. He has  not yet pleaded to two fraud charges involving R23,464. According to the charge sheet, Legal Aid SA engages legal practitioners in private practice to defend indigent persons in need of free legal representation, through the Judicare system. Pitlele was engaged by legal aid authorities in July 2006, to represent an accused in a Western Cape High Court criminal trial. Pitlele allegedly billed legal aid authorities in February 2007, for R11,577, and falsely specified that the trial had run from February 12 to 27, and was still running. The bill was approved, and payment made into his bank account. According to the charge sheet, the case was then allocated to another advocate to complete the partly heard matter. The second advocate finalised the case, and stated in his account that he had in fact started and finalised the case, and that the matter was not partly heard when he took over. On the second fraud charge, Pitlele allegedly billed legal aid for R14,210, for work he had not done in the Western Cape High Court.

The consumer price index gained 1.5 percent from a year ago, compared to a 1.4 percent increase in December, according to Statistics Korea. It marked the third straight month that inflation has remained in the 1.0-2.0 percent range since November when it fell to 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent the previous month. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, stood at 1.2  percent in January from a year ago -- unchanged from the December figure.

But both sides also said it was up to the other to make the first move to restart the stalled talks, which are aimed at avoiding a messy legal battle at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Negotiations floundered last month with both sides blaming the other for an abrupt end to a telephone call between EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson and US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, the former US top trade negotiator. But by Tuesday the EU and the US had cooled down enough to give talks another chance although it looked unlikely they would broker a deal by a Monday deadline. \"The commission is prepared to resume discussions as soon as the  Americans are ready,\" spokeswoman Francoise Le Bail told a news conference. That followed on the heels of comments from Zoellick saying that  the ball was in the Europeans' court for restarting talks and that the US was willing to extend the current \"standstill\" period to negotiate a solution if the Europeans wanted. \"If it takes more time for a standstill, fine, have a standstill, but that will be for the European side to determine,\" he said, adding that the EU had not given him an indication that that was what it wanted. In October the United States lodged a complaint at the WTO against what it insisted were unfair government subsidies provided to European aircraft maker Airbus. That action prompted a counter-suit from Brussels against what it said was indirect US government aid for Boeing through defense and research contracts. Then in January the two sides, in a bid to avoid a bruising legal battle, pulled back from WTO intervention by agreeing to a 90-day \"standstill\" period -- which ends April 11 -- to negotiate a  phasing-out of subsidies to develop commercial aircraft. But Zoellick said last week that Washington and Brussels would probably miss the deadline. The European Commission's Le Bail said Tuesday that the April 11  deadline still stood and that \"we have had no reaction so far to the proposals which have been made\" by EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson. She added that the commission had proposed a step-by-step approach to resolve the dispute. Zoellick said that if the case ended up going to the WTO for settlement he was confident the US would win. \"I think they will have a hard time making the case under the WTO rules which is one reason why one saw Europe wanting to enter into the negotiations because we said let's look at the WTO rules and I'm not sure the WTO rules allow them to make the case they want to make.\" Zoellick was in Brussels to discuss the subsidies issue, among other matters, with the EU external relations commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, in place of trade chief Mandelson, who was abroad.

Obama is announcing that he's nominating Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. He says Garland is widely recognized for his excellence. He's pointing to Garland's experience as a law clerk, a prosecutor and as chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Obama says he went through a rigorous and comprehensive process to pick his nominee. He says he sought to set aside short-term expediency and \"narrow politics.\" The president says he reached out to every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to seek advice about the nomination. __ 11:00 a.m. Republicans are holding firm against letting President Barack Obama pick the next Supreme Court justice after learning that Obama is nominating federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts says even though he voted for Garland when he was first confirmed in 1997, he's opposed now. He says it's not about the nominee, but about the process. Roberts says Garland \"may very well be a very good nominee.\" Still, he says the American people should decide and not Obama. Senate Republicans have insisted for weeks that they won't hold hearings or a confirmation vote on Obama's pick. Some Republicans have even said they'd refuse to meet with Obama's nominee. ___ 10:15 a.m. The White House says President Barack Obama is nominating federal appellate judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because nobody is better suited to serve immediately. Obama plans to announce his nomination on Wednesday morning in the Rose Garden. Garland is the chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and would replace the late Antonin Scalia. The White House says Garland has more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history, and that he's known for building consensus.","label":0}

Missing from the list published on the court's website was the nation's strongman Andry Rajoelina, ousted leader Marc Ravalomanana's wife Lalao, and former president Didier Ratsiraka. Their candidacies have been internationally condemned. The presidential election -- meant to end a four-year political deadlock -- has been repeatedly put on hold amid controversy over the candidacies of the three frontrunners. The three had refused to stand aside even in the face of threats of sanctions. Madagascar has been mired in political limbo since Rajoelina, a former disc jockey and ex-mayor of the capital Antananarivo, seized power in 2009. He swore not to run for president but threw his hat in the race when the wife of his exiled rival Ravalomanana declared she would be a candidate. Both pose a legal problem, since Rajoelina applied after the deadline and Lalao Ravalomanana has not lived in Madagascar six months prior to the nominations, as the election rules require. Ratsiraka had also filed his candidacy papers two days after he returned from 11 years of exile in France. Sapa-AFP \/kn","label":0}

New Zealand's interest rates are among the highest in the developed world, but Alan Bollard, governor of the Reserve Bank, said that although an economic slow-down was predicted, the economy  remained very strong and a further tightening of monetary policy was necessary. New Zealand's consumer price index rose 2.7 per cent last year and Bollard said inflation was expected to remain toward the top of  the bank's one per cent to three per cent target band over the medium term, providing little headroom to absorb additional inflation pressures. The bank's decision surprised some analysts, who said it would hoist interest rates for home mortgages to about nine per cent. But others had predicted it, with the Bank of New Zealand saying  earlier this week the economy was \"on fire\" and not slowing enough to keep the lid on inflation. Bollard said economic growth was not now projected to slow until  later this year as world demand and export prices moderated. He left open the possibility of further interest rate rises, saying: \"Certainly, the current outlook offers little scope for an easing of policy in the foreseeable future.\"  Sapa-dpa","label":0}

Zambian President Edgar Lungu was delivering a speech to commemorate International Women's Day at Heroes Stadium in the capital Lusaka on Sunday when he felt ill. An aid managed to catch Lungu as he fell backward, The Post newspaper reported. While musicians came on stage to perform before a shocked crowd, the president was carried away, The Post reported. A snap diagnosis said the president suffered from malaria and fatigue, according to a statement issued after the incident. But further medical tests on Monday ruled out malaria, which can be a deadly disease, said Amos Chanda, the president's assistant. Lungu was admitted to the Maina Soko Military Hospital where observation showed that the president's blood sugar levels had dropped significantly, leading to his collapse, Chanda said in a statement. The recently elected president has a history of a condition that narrows his  esophagus, or food pipe, which led to his low sugar levels. The condition, known as achalasia, was first treated 30 years ago and has recently recurred, Chanda said. Soon after being admitted to the hospital, Lungu assured his supporters that  he was recovering well. \"There is nothing to worry about,\" President Lungu said in the statement. Lungu became president in January this year, succeeding Michael Sata who died last year after a long illness. Rumors swirled about Sata's poor health for months when the late president was rarely seen in public. Sata reassured Zambians that he was fit to lead just weeks before he died. The Zambian Medical Association commended Lungu's officials for their transparency about the new president's health. \"If he had just departed without any explanation, that would have fueled unnecessary speculation,\" said Aaron Mujajati, the association's president. Lungu's office has released updates on his health, with journalists invited to visit Lungu while in hospital, The Post newspaper reported. Sapa-AP \/gq\/th","label":0}
{"id":"5da6f8190d8400001782805c","url":"SAP20130211S8424.txt","text":"by Ivan Couronne (=(File Picture)=) Europe: 1,662 turbines; United States: 0. After delays that left the American industry years behind other nations, the first wind farm off the US coast should finally produce electricity by 2015. With Americans living atop mountains of coal and reserves of petroleum and natural gas, it is little wonder there is resistance to financing a renewable but expensive offshore energy resource that remains untapped in the United States. Despite several proposals, and the blessing of environmentalists who describe them as sustainable alternatives to coal, not a single wind farm off the Atlantic coast has been built. Several are in the works, but they have run up against political hurdles in states like Maryland and Virginia, where lawmakers are hesitant to offer government subsidies. As veteran energy expert Jim Lanard, president of the Offshore Wind Development Coalition, noted, Europeans jumped ahead with heavy subsidization of renewables like wind because they lacked the oil to meet their energy needs. With far more indigenous energy supply, \"there's less pressure for the United States to do more in the renewable sector than in Europe, where there's a greater pressure to achieve energy independence,\" Lanard told AFP. \"If you're from a state with lots of coal, it doesn't matter if you are a Democrat or a Republican, you're going to support an energy policy with coal,\" Lanard said. Coal provides 37 percent of US electricity, compared to natural gas at 30 percent. Far behind is onshore wind at 3.4 percent, but offshore resources would help boost that figure. For some US lawmakers the jury is still out as to how human activity influences climate change. The American public has shown a stubborn indifference to the phenomenon compared to Europeans. But wind received a shot in the arm in January, when Congress extended tax credits on all wind energy projects for this year. Such grants can amount to 30  percent of investment costs. Two offshore projects in particular will benefit, including Cape Wind, whose  130 huge turbines are being developed in Massachusetts for the waters near Martha's Vineyard, the tony island playground where President Barack Obama and other VIPs spend their vacations. One of the state's richest men, the billionaire conservative coal and gas investor Bill Koch, has spent years campaigning in vain against the project. A smaller wind farm of five turbines in water three miles (five kilometers) off Block Island, in the state of Rhode Island, is aimed at replacing diesel generators which have powered the community for years. Electricity generated by offshore wind costs two to three times more than onshore wind, according to Steve Clemmer, who heads energy research for the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's really more economical to develop projects on land,\" Clemmer told AFP. That is especially true in the United States, where on-land wind resources are more abundant than in Europe. Cape Wind will sell energy for 18.7 cents per kilowatt hour for the first year. By comparison, a coal-fired plant can produce electricity at about 10 cents per kWh. Electricity from onshore wind farms can be even cheaper. Offshore wind can be a money pit: extensive research is needed to identify the best location and assess risks to marine life; installation, maintenance and replacement in deep water can incur crushing costs, and the use of boats to  transport equipment and workers runs up the bill. Some states like New Jersey, despite experts proclaiming viability for offshore wind, have let projects wither. Operators have thrown in the towel for  lack of funding. But technology favors projects in the open water, where winds are strongest.  The government estimates combined offshore potential for 10 projects at 3,800 megawatts, the equivalent of three nuclear power plants and enough to power millions of homes in the crowded northeast. A new technology being developed, for deepwater \"floating\" turbines, also solves a central criticism of wind power: visual and noise pollution. A first contract has been approved in the state of Maine. Job creation is the ultimate carrot for cautious states, and expert Michael Conathan at the Center for American Progress think tank said there is value in being an early entrant. \"If you are first, you are going to be effectively in the driver seat for who gets the shoreside industrial development, who's going to get the jobs (and) where they'll build the first turbine construction facility,\" he said.

Thomas Tyler, for Maqubela, called Arina Smit to the stand as a defence witness in mitigation of sentence. She has worked for the National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Re-integration of Offenders (Nicro) for 18 years. She said 60-year-old Maqubela was the eldest of seven children and grew up in a very religious home, with patriarchal structures clear in the family and in church. Maqubela developed an anxious ambivalent attachment style in her relationships as a child. \"Although the accused within her core family unit might have received consistent parenting on many occasions, the insecurity that the apartheid regime provided to black families didn't necessarily allow them to optimally focus on emotional needs and relationships with their children, because they were in survival mode,\" Smit said. This relationship pattern translated to a preoccupied way of relating in relationships as an adult, with wanting to keep a person close and being hyper-sensitive to even minor perceived changes in the relationship. \"When the attachment system is activated, it triggers and hijacks the brain to re-establish the connection to the person who is perceived to be slipping away,\" Smit said. This type of impulsive, desperate protest behaviour could be perceived as obsessive by an outsider. Tyler asked what would happen should such a personality fail to receive affirmation in the relationship. Smit replied that the person would do whatever they felt needed to be done to bring a person closer to them, including activities which may not be considered appropriate, like talking to a partner's boss about trouble in the marriage. Last November, the same court found Maqubela guilty of killing her acting judge husband Patrick Maqubela in June 2009, despite not having conclusive medical evidence pinpointing a cause of death. She was found guilty of forging her husband's will and committing fraud by causing potential prejudice to his estate. The acting judge was based at the Western Cape High Court at the time of his  death. Maqubela's defence had asked Smit to compile a pre-sentencing report a week ago to help the court arrive at an appropriate sanction. Her 50-page report and CV were handed up to Judge John Murphy. The report was based on three face-to-face interviews with Maqubela, interviews with her family, and collateral information from other documents. In court on Wednesday, Maqubela wore a brown suit and multicoloured head wrap, along with her infamous sunglasses. Sapa \/je\/jk","label":0}

This is as declared by the Auditor General (AG) in the financial statements to be served in Tshwane Council tomorrow Thursday... This administration has, to date, made great strides towards stabilising its finances,\" Msimanga said. \"This was achieved by strengthening the controls over supply chain processes, slashing unauthorised and unnecessary expenditure, extricating the city from unlawful and expensive contracts like the PEU smart prepaid meter contract which the AG flagged as one of the biggest items of irregular expenditure which has now been addressed.\" He said the City of Tshwane was in the process of \"disentangling itself from wholly unaffordable\" broadband and fleet management contracts entered into by the previous administration led by former mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa. Msimanga said he was optimistic that by the end of the next financial year, Tshwane would have untangled itself from the unaffordable contracts. \"This has contributed to our successes in correcting the R2 billion deficit we inherited and has resulted in the surplus in these financial statements. It is common cause that a long-term financial plan is an essential tool that a municipality needs to facilitate financial sustainability and resilience, and improve the municipality's capacity on its developmental and service delivery mandate on a sustainable basis,\" said Msimanga. \"Appreciating that the biggest of our financial predicaments are behind us; we must now look forward to cultivating a financially sustainable Tshwane. This is for the purposes of making the city work for its people. Achieving these ends required us to adhere to the two guiding principles of stabilisation and revitalisation that will help us realise our commitment to better, more efficient service delivery.\" Among other achievements, Msimanga said his administration has since managed to arrest unauthorised expenditure, unauthorised expenditure, and irregular expenditure. \"Fiscal discipline is the basis for all organisations to effectively realise set objectives. It is this discipline that has garnered us these results. Specifically, unauthorised expenditure was significantly reduced from R1.658 billion in 2015\/16 to R620 million in 2016\/17. Unauthorised expenditure is defined as expenditure incurred otherwise than in accordance with an approved budget. This over-expenditure can mainly be attributes to employee-related costs, bulk purchases, depreciation, finance charges and contracted services,\" said Msimanga. \"Irregular expenditure decreased from R950 million in 2015\/16 to R838 million in 2016\/17. The irregular expenditure relating to the PEU smart prepaid meter contract totalled R699 million included in this amount. Cash available to the city as at 30 June 2017 totalled R2.1 billion compared to R1.2 billion the previous period. The increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year was therefore R950 million.\" Msimanga was accompanied by the Tshwane MMC for Finance Mare-Lise Fourie at the briefing. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Devereaux Morkel","label":0}

The 72-hole championship tees off at the Home of Golf's New Course on Friday, with the action switching to the famous Old Course for the second round on Saturday. Based on the strength of the field, the St Andrews Links Trophy is ranked one of the strongest amateur tournaments in the world, and it is arguably one of the strongest championships outside the Amateur Championship in the British Isles. Smith and fellow Golf RSA National Squad members Jovan Rebula, Albert Venter, James du Preez, Andre Nel, Tristen Strydom, Aubrey Beckley and Kyle McClatchie got their feet wet in the Carrick Neill Scottish Open Stroke Play Championship at Gullane Golf Club last week. McClatchie was the lone South African to survive the cut and posted an impressive top nine finish. Ekurhuleni's Angus Ellis-Cole further strengthens the country's presence at St Andrews. Last year, the South African posse started their annual trip to the United Kingdom at the St Andrews Links Trophy, but foul weather sent the entire cast packing after organisers were forced to cancel the second round. \"It was a huge blow to the team because we all started poorly and was counting on the second round to make up some ground,\" Smith said. \"This year we had a chance to warm up at the Scottish Stroke Play and we have had the benefit of a few practice rounds at St Andrews to become properly acquainted with links layouts.\" The South Africans from part of a large international entry looking to break the British stronghold on the championship. Since its inception in 1989, only three international competitors have won the St Andrews Links Trophy, including Australian Stuart Bouvier in 1990 and Dutchman Daan Huizing in 2012. Last year, Federico Zucchetti from Milan became the first Italian to succeed after the Molinari brothers, Eduardo and Francesco, as well as Matteo Mannaserro failed in recent years. \"It's definitely not easy to beat the Brits at home, but last week an Australian showed us that it can be done at the Scottish Stroke Play,\" McClatchie said. \"It is imperative, though, that we start well, but it will depend on the draw and the weather. Like last week, most of the South Africans had early tee times in the first round at Gullane and the conditions were really rough with high winds and mist. \"I had the benefit of a late start and teed off in relatively mild weather and it made all the difference to my start in the championship. The conditions will definitely have an impact, especially here at St Andrews with the open layout.\" Smith will start the SA challenge at 07h00, followed by Ellis-Cole, Venter, Beckley, Strydom and McClatchie, while Nel leads the afternoon starters that includes Du Preez and Rebula. \u2013 African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

Markus Schnapka, who heads the social affairs department in Bornheim, said other visitors had complained of sexual harassment by men living in a nearby asylum-seeker shelter. He said none of the complaints were on the criminal level and the pool had agreed the ban would end once social workers confirmed the men \"got the message.\" Bornheim is a few kilometers (miles) south of Cologne, which saw hundreds of robberies and sexual assaults during New Year's celebrations that police blamed largely on foreigners. The attacks have stoked a fierce debate in Germany about how to integrate the almost 1.1 million asylum-seekers who arrived last year. In the poll published Friday, 66 percent of the 1,203 respondents said Germany can't handle the migrant influx, up from 46 percent in December. The percentage who thought the country could manage so many refugees fell from 51 percent in December to 37 percent during the Jan. 12-14 poll conducted for public broadcaster ZDF. The share of Germans who believe crime will increase rose to 70 percent, compared with 62 percent the last time the question was asked in October. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 points. The poll also showed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's popularity had declined somewhat compared with the previous month. The assaults in Cologne appear to have contributed to the shift in opinion for some. A third of the respondents said their attitude toward asylum-seekers and refugee issues had changed due to the attacks, which have dominated media coverage in Germany this month. But the majority, 66 percent, said it hadn't changed their opinion. A spokesman for Cologne's prosecutors said authorities are still receiving more criminal complaints in relation to the New Year's attacks. Police have said the perpetrators were among about 1,000 drunken men primarily of \"Arab or North African origin,\" some of whom were asylum-seekers. A total of 751 people have filed 676 criminal complaints, including 347 allegations of sexual assault, said spokesman Ulrich Bremer.","label":0}

Alexis Tsipras remarks came hours after lawmakers in Germany, a key rescue loan provider, overwhelmingly approved the four-month extension of Greece's extant deal. \"The bailout agreements are over, both in form and in essence,\" Tsipras told  a cabinet meeting. \"Some people are betting on a third bailout in June ... but we will disappoint them.\" Tsipras' radical left Syriza party, which is governing in coalition with the  small right-wing Independent Greeks, was elected a month ago on a highly ambitious platform of cancelling the austerity measures that accompanied Greece's 240 billion euro ($270 billion) rescue loans. But despite repeated and often unorthodox attempts to win over other European creditor countries, Greece was forced to retreat from initial electoral promises that included a massive new write-down of the country's crushing debt. Last week, fellow members of the 19-member eurozone agreed on the four-month  loan agreement extension, in return for which Greece offered a fluid commitment  to budget reforms. Tsipras said his first act of legislation would be to table a draft law on Monday to address what Syriza calls the \"humanitarian crisis\" -extensive poverty brought about by the deep income cuts and shockingly high unemployment resulting from creditor-mandated cutbacks. \"This is our foremost duty toward a society that has been severely tried for  five years,\" he said. \"The bill will contain specific action to provide free power and food to thousands of families that need it, to make Greece once again  a civilized country ... So that no child is cold, no child faints from hunger or goes to school hungry.\" Tsipras also pledged to provide housing for 30,000 people, limit evictions, and facilitate payment terms for an estimated 3.7 million people with tax debts  of up to 5,000 euros ($5,620). Critics, including several within the governing Syriza party, have accused the government of capitulation and backtracking on its election promises. About 8,000 Communist Party supporters gathered outside Parliament on Friday  in the first sizeable anti-government demonstration as Tsipras convened his Cabinet. Earlier, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told Ant1 television that the vagueness in the agreement with eurozone finance ministers was what Greece's EU  partners wanted. \"We are very proud of the degree of ambiguity. And I use a term, constructive ambiguity,\" Varoufakis said. On the issue of increasing value added tax, Varoufakis insisted it would not  be increased on islands or border areas, or for medications, food, or books. VAT was reduced in some areas and for some items from 23 percent to 13 percent,  but Greece's creditors have sought for it to be increased in order to raise tax  revenue for state coffers. \"I will search to find a tax rate on an insignificant item so we can show goodwill,\" Varoufakis said. The government, meanwhile, has a liquidity crunch to deal with. The country's creditors have said they will not release the remaining funds in Greece's bailout until the government presents concrete measures, expected to be agreed on by April. Money has been tight, and figures released Friday showed Greece's economy shrank slightly in the fourth quarter of 2014. The statistics authority said the economy contracted 0.4 percent compared with the third quarter, on seasonally adjusted basis. Greece's economy has lost a quarter of its value compared to pre-crisis levels in 2008. Sapa-AP \/lp","label":1}

Now she and new coach Emmarie Fouche are in Europe on a learning curve as they build towards the African Athletics Championships and then the biggest of them all, the Rio showpiece in August. Prinsloo took part in the Golden Roof Challenge in Innsbruck, a challenge with a difference as field athletes take part in a specially made track in the high street. \"It was a lovely meeting,\" Prinsloo told Road to Rio 2016 on Friday. \"It was in the city strew and the track was really quick but we took part for three hours as there were big waits between jumps so it got real cold and difficult to perform properly but I really enjoyed it. \"The body is feeling good and now I'm taking part in Gervardo, Italy on Sunday and then Emmarie and I are heading back home. The main focus now is on African Championships and we're going to train hard at home for that.\" Prinsloo also emphasised the importance of this particular trip. \"We really came to see how the body reacts to competition and travel etc. \"We were still deep in winter training for two weeks before we came over here so haven't sharpened up at all for the 10 days that I've been here.\" Fouche added: \"The travelling has been quite strenuous.

The minutes of the ECB's governing council January meeting, released on Thursday, showed that the bank's top officials are worried that \"global economic growth and global trade growth were decelerating.\" Council members said this was happening \"in a context of heightened volatility in global financial and commodity markets and weaker global confidence.\" The meeting's protocol also showed the ECB governing council's 25 members concluding a deterioration of \"emerging market economies in particular\". \"In China, the ongoing economic rebalancing ... could turn out to be more pronounced than expected and trigger a hard landing,\" the ECB policymakers warned. Many analysts believe that the bank will launch another set of monetary measures when it meets on March 10. \"The minutes strongly indicate that the ECB governing council is preparing for more action,\" said Jessica Hinds, European economist with the research group Capital Economics. Speaking after the council meeting on January 7, ECB chief Mario Draghi told a press conference that there were \"no limits\" to what the ECB will do to meet its inflation target and spur economic growth. The ECB chief said the bank planned to review and possibly reconsider its monetary policy stance at its March meeting. The governing council members also discussed at their January meeting whether Europe's current low levels of inflation were now part of part of wage deals and the prices set by business. The Frankfurt-based ECB has already launched a series of steps aimed at addressing its concerns about economic growth and inflation, including a monthly 60 billion euros (66.5 billion dollars) as part of a bond-buying programme launched last March. But at just 0.4 per cent, annual inflation still falls well short of the ECB's goal of a year-on-year inflation rate just short of 2 per cent. The bank's net profit rose to 1.082 billion euros in 2015, compared with 989 million euros in 2014, the ECB said on Thursday. This comes as a result of the interest earned on the bonds it has so far acquired under its bond-buying scheme as well as charges related to the ECB's new bank supervisory role. # Notebook * * * * The following information is not intended for publication ## Editorial contacts - Reporting by: Andrew McCathie - Editing by: Coman Hamilton, +49 30 2852 31472, amc coh rmo","label":0}

In the aftermath of a devastating war drawing in six other countries between 1998 and 2003, the vast central African country has embarked on an internationally-monitored transition process that is supposed to lead to its first free and democratic polls since independence from Belgium in 1960. \"For now, no one is speaking officially of a delay, because no one in the government wants to assume responsibility for announcing  the bad news to people stricken by years of war and deprivation,\" the observer said. A diplomat in the capital Kinshasa said: \"The people think they have been given a promise. If this electoral promise is not kept there will be new riots which, if they are exploited, can plunge the country back into a quasi-civil war.\" He said elections should be held \"at all costs\" even if the zone  of the fighting that broke out Sunday, claiming dozens of lives, has to be excluded from the polls. \"The country is immense. Even excluding Nord Kivu, the elections  would be representative, and this is the calculation many Congolese  leaders are making, knowing full well the risks they would take by cancelling the vote,\" he said. But another diplomat said excluding Nord Kivu would rekindle anger among Congolese of Rwandan origin living in the province, who  could turn for support to Rwanda -- which backed two successive rebel movements in the DRC, in 1996 and 1998. The first toppled the dictator Mubuto Sese Seko, while the second agreed in 2003 to join the government and army of President Joseph Kabila. The second diplomat added that elections would be difficult to organize without a restructuring of the army. \"The Congolese army is still just an aggregate of former rebel movements who are going in backwards into a unified national force, one of the great goals of the transition,\" he said. \"What's more, the draft electoral law excludes soldiers from the  vote. Instead of guaranteeing the neutrality of armed groups -- the  purpose intended by the government -- this decision could have the opposite effect of making them contest an election that didn't involve them individually,\" he added. A military expert here played down the importance of the fighting, which he predicted would not last long. \"The Congolese army will end up succeeding in getting its reinforcements there, and fighting will become sporadic.\" If so, he  said, a \"small chance\" remains that elections will be held on time.

The Deputy President cautioned that South Africa as a whole could not succeed if a segment of the population remained oppressed  through violence and abuse.  The importance of family life was also emphasised in the discussions with the traditional leaders. Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka urged the leaders to help in the promotion of family values.   'We meet today during the 16 Days of Activism For No Violence Against Women and Children. You have a crucial role to play in this  area. We need you more than we sometimes realise. The role of traditional leaders is critical in areas and campaigns such HIV and  AIDS and the Moral Regeneration Movement (MRM). These battles are all linked with the ability to improve how our society works and values its people and values its women and children,' said the Deputy President.   'I wish today to make a special appeal to you and to ask you to be a partner in the fight against violence directed at women and children, let us engage with families and communities. Let us go back to our villages and deal with the breakdown of values,' she said.   The Deputy President told the traditional leaders that through their membership and participation in the South African National Aids Council (SANAC) and MRM, she was formally asking them to work with her to develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with both issues of combating the perpetuation of violence against women and children and as well as dealing with combating the spread of HIV and AIDS.   'I, together with all of government, want to improve and strengthen our cooperation with our traditional leaders. There are at least fourteen government departments which have interest in the  traditional leadership, and traditional matters,' said Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka.   Government is serious about ensuring that traditional leadership  issues are central to its work, hence it is looking very closely at  the issues of a strategic nature that have been raised by the National House of Traditional Leaders, on how to develop a government-wide support to the institution of traditional leadership.   Continuing with the address the Deputy President highlighted some economic opportunities related to the institution of traditional leadership.  'We expect you to encourage the development of traditional dances (indlamu\/umxhenso and others) to let others experience for the first time what is true African culture. This will contribute to the development of small and medium enterprises in rural communities,' said the Deputy President.   'You need to develop and encourage your people who run their bread and breakfast facilities to concentrate on exhibiting our own  African cuisine and foodstuffs. Tourists must not leave our country  without experiencing our traditional foodstuffs like umnqgusho, mopani worms, mogodu, jeqe, and many cuisines that South Africa is famous for,' she concluded   ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENCY ENQUIRIES: THABANG CHILOANE 082 888 8783  Ends","label":0}

Reverend Tsele, the general secretary of the SA Council of Churches (SACC) had been invited by sister organisation the Zimbabwe Council of Churches to observe Thursday's general election  in the country. When he arrived at Beit Bridge border post on Monday he was told  by Zimbabwean immigration officials that he had not made the government's list of accredited election observers, he said. \"Despite this refusal for us to monitor we will continue to support the process of resolving the Zimbabwean crisis,\" he said. \"We respect the government's right to allow whoever they want to  allow.\" Cosatu spokesman Paul Notyhawa said representatives from the Southern African Trade Union Coordination Council and the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) had also been kept off the list. \"It is now quite clear that the government is only admitting observers they consider to be politically sympathetic to ZANU-PF. This will seriously undermine the credibility of the verdict they reach on whether the elections were free and fair,\" Notyhawa said in a statement. The Zimbabwean government only announced its list of accredited observers on Tuesday, which critics say is just one more mechanism to allow them to make sure the elections go their way. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change is convinced that there is no possibility of democratic elections in the country, although they decided to take part anyway. Sapa","label":0}

Hogle Zoo spokeswoman Erica Hansen said Wednesday that officials found a trail of leopard hair around the 6-inch-by-6-inch opening built into the enclosure's mesh. The rare animal escaped Tuesday morning and was found snoozing on an outdoor beam about 2 feet from the exhibit. The zoo plans to move the 4-year-old female to a different enclosure that has smaller openings in its mesh. Hansen says the animal weighs about 60 pounds and is one of the smallest leopards the zoo has had in the exhibit. ___ 9:40 a.m. A leopard that was tranquilized after it got loose at a Salt Lake City zoo is awake and doing well. Hogle Zoo spokeswoman Erica Hansen said Wednesday that staff members tested the Amur leopard's blood and have determined that it is in good health. The rare animal escaped from an enclosure Tuesday morning and was found snoozing on the outdoor beam about 2 feet from the exhibit. Officials are investigating how the leopard managed to escape the tall steel-grade mesh that surrounds the top and sides of its enclosure. It's not clear how long it was out, but zoo staff saw the leopard inside the enclosure at about 7 a.m. and the escape was reported about two and half hours later.

The IEA said that a dominant factor in the global energy market now \"has a lot to do with political risk writ large, and not just in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya or Venezuela\", and including regulatory risks. The IEA said that its estimates for global oil demand this year suddenly looked tighter mainly because of unexpectedly strong data for demand in the United States and China in the last quarter of last year, but it also said that  some data was uncertain and would be volatile. The agency raised its forecast for global oil demand this year by 240,000 barrels per day from its estimate in December to 90.8 million barrels per day, and to 930,000 bpd or 1.0 percent more than in 2012. On the attack on the In Amenas gas field in Algeria on Wednesday, the IEA warned: \"The 16 January kidnapping and murder of foreign oil workers at the In Amenas gas field has cast a dark cloud over the outlook for the country's energy sector. \"Production at the field was shut in, including an estimated 50,000 barrels per day of condensate,\" the IEA said, referring to claims by Islamist attackers  that they had acted in retaliation for French military action against Islamists  in Mali. The IEA noted that the In Amenas field was a joint venture grouping the operator Statoil, BP and state-run Sonatrach and involving Japanese engineering  firm JGC. The IEA, the energy arm of the 34-member Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the outlook for its first monthly report of the year \"paints a sobering\" view of the oil market. In \"one fell swoop\" the estimated demand for oil from members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the last quarter of last year had risen by 400,000 barrels per day. \"All of a sudden the market looks tighter than we thought,\" the IEA said. Under a headline \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", the IEA said that owing to uncertainty about data, notably concerning demand in China and production in  Saudi Arabia, it might be too early to \"declare the start of a new market cycle  or a return to the bull market of yesteryear.\" However, it pointed to a potential rebound. The bull market of 2003-08 was driven by demand and worries about supplies. A bear market followed, driven by the financial crisis. Now \"political risk\" is a central driving factor, including regulatory issues and changes, the IEA said. \"Changes in tax and trade policies, in China as in Russia, can, at the stroke of a pen, shake up crude and products markets and redraw the oil trade map,\" it said. The countries in the OECD area are also at risk in part because \"above-ground\" issues such as export and shipping legislation have become misaligned. Sapa-AFP \/nsm","label":1}

GM South Africa's vice-president for sales and marketing Malcolm Gauld said the company remained confident that its new products would add more choice and value to its customers. \"It also allows us to compete aggressively in this extremely competitive market,\" he said. He said although the company expected the overall market to decline by between 2 percent and 3 percent -- which was slightly inside what other industry players were forecasting -- long-term growth remained positive. Gauld emphasised that there were still opportunities in the vehicle market, even though the industry faced significant challenges this year  such as higher interest rates, inflation, petrol prices and general erosion of consumer disposable income. He said a key area for GM South Africa was the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market where it had secured an overall share of 23 percent. \"Even though the LCV is likely to remain relatively flat versus 2007, we will be looking to continue to grow our volumes in 2008. \"The Corsa Utility has been the leader in the half-ton segment of the market for an incredible 32 months,\" he said. GM also expected the addition of the new Isuzu KB range, launched recently, to acquire a more dominant position in other segments of the LCV market. Referring to the passenger market, Gauld said the company was particularly pleased about its Chevrolet range of vehicles. \"Chevrolet sales grew 44 percent from 2005 to 2006 and by a further 18 percent in 2007. We are extremely encouraged by this fantastic performance and expect to continue to build momentum in terms of the growth of our Chevrolet brand in 2008.\" Gauld said the GM South Africa retailer network, standing at 152 outlets, had invested R812 million in the past few years to upgrade the  facilities. He said nine premium dealerships retailed Cadillac, Hummer and Saab. The company would invest R481 million in its operations in 2008. This would be earmarked for upgrading its production facilities and tooling. Progress on a vehicle conversion and distribution centre in Aloes, Port Elizabeth was also underway. The multi-million rand facility would facilitate storage and logistical operations and was due to open in the second quarter of the year. Gauld was positive in the long-term about the future of the industry. He said the automotive industry enjoyed a buoyant performance the last few years and the slowdown at present was normal considering the interest rate increases and the introduction of the National Credit Act  last year. \"With the 2010 Soccer World Cup on our doorstep, we have to look positively at the demand for new vehicles,\" he said.

The central bank Friday raised its economic growth target this year to 6.0-6.5 percent, up from 5.5 to 6.0 percent previously, after a better-than-expected showing of 5.2 percent in 2003. For the second time in a year, Bank Negara Malaysia also eased exchange control rules to cut the cost of doing business as part of  a drive to boost competitiveness and curb a flight of investors to lower-cost countries such as China. It announced it would implement a new interest rate framework in  the next few months to improve efficiency in the financial markets and assured rates would remain low. But it rejected pressure to free-float the local currency, fixed  at 3.80 to the dollar since 1998, saying in its annual report that the peg was still sustainable despite the weaker US unit and crucial to boost trade and investment. The rosy prospects and new measures, coming less than a week after Abdullah's ruling coalition crushed Islamic fundamentalists in a March 21 vote, will raise the country's attractiveness to the global business community, economists say. It is expected to bring cheer to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, which has risen by some 13 percent after recently hitting  its highest level in nearly four years. But some economists say the stability of the ringgit peg remains  a concern amid continued weakness in the dollar and potential devaluation of the Chinese yuan. \"After having received a thumping win in the recent elections, the report is another morale booster for the economy as well as the  market,\" said Manokaran Mottain, economist with SBB Securities. \"Investors, especially foreign fund managers, will be excited by  the new policies on foreign exchange and the proposed interest rate  framework, which allays fears of a rate hike.\" Azrul Azwar, economist with MIDF-Sisma Securities, said the new growth target would be Malaysia's best result since the 8.5 percent  expansion in 2000, making it one of the top performers in the region this year after China, Thailand and India. He said the easing of forex rules, especially allowing unit trust and insurance firms to invest abroad and for multi-national companies to issue ringgit bonds to raise funds locally, was \"revolutionary\" and part of preparations for financial sector liberalisation in 2007. \"It appears to be a preemptive move to mitigate any possible inflows of hot money into the system that could cause overheating. It will certainly boost Malaysia's attractiveness to investors,\" he  said. But there are potential risks. These included US economic growth, ringgit peg stability, pressure to sustain local interest rates if global rates reverse their trend, renewed fears of terrorist attacks on US interests after the recent Middle East turmoil and a potential revisit of deadly virus outbreaks, analysts say. SBB Manokaran said the peg was unlikely to be changed in the short-term but the government should consider a review later in the  year once it is clear the US economic recovery is sustained. \"The ringgit peg remains a risk and the government's next move should be to review the peg. They should do this at a time of economic strength,\" he added. Bank Negara also revised Malaysia's budget deficit, which has been a major concern, up to 4.5 percent of GDP this year, from 3.3 percent previously, citing lower tax revenues and lower development  expenditure. But it stressed fiscal consolidation remained on track and development would be targetted at strengthening longer-term productivity and competitiveness. Sapa-AFP","label":0}

This comes after the rail link between Hatfield and Pretoria stations was closed around 8h30 on Thursday morning allegedly due to a derailment of the Gautrain. Hundreds of passengers were forced to use alternative transport after they were evacuated from the Gautrain following the suspension of operations as a \"minor derailment\" occurred when the train approached Hatfield station. Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng spokesperson on roads and transport, Neil Campbell, accused the GMA of keeping the investigation away from the public. \"A derailment of a Gautrain cannot be shrouded in the secrecy which the Gautrain Management Agency seems to employ when problems arise on the network,\" Campbell said. \"If the closure was due to a derailment, an internal investigation will not be sufficient to reassure the public that the train is safe to ride.\" Campbell said this would be an ideal opportunity for the Rail Safety Regulator to investigate the matter, but it was unlikely that they would have the capacity to do so given the financial constraints on the regulator. In response, GMA senior executive manager of communication and marketing, Barbara Jensen, said the Rail Safety Regulator was in any such incident, in any case, involved in the investigation. \"The Gautrain Management Agency is waiting for the findings to come in and then will release information to the public. Nothing is shrouded in mystery,\" Jensen said. But the DA seemed unsatisfied. Campbell said that the MEC for Roads and Transport, Ismail Vadi, must establish independent inquiry into Gautrain derailment. \"The DA is of the opinion that independent experts must be appointed and report back to Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC, Ismail Vadi and the Provincial Portfolio Committee who must be convinced of the train's safety,\" Campbell said. \"The public has a right to know why the train derailed as a matter of urgency.\" - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The sarugby.co.za website reports that the game itself was not much of a spectacle with only three tries being scored - all by the Pumas. Truth be told, the Bulldogs never looked like crossing their opponents' line but in the first half, they showed a vast improvement in their defence work compared with last season which had materially helped them to their three consecutive wins to get their campaign really moving well earlier this month. But some weak defence leading to two tries in the second stanza by the Pumas put paid to any chance they might have had of winning four in a row. The visitors virtually camped on the Border tryline for the first six minutes of the match and there was little doubt at that point that the Pumas pack was the stronger and the Bulldogs had a tough encounter on their hands. The Pumas lock, Stephan Greeff had a magnificent game at the line-outs while their flank, one of the smallest men on the field, Marnus Schoeman, played his heart out throughout and was a constant thorn in the Bulldogs' flesh. The only score for the Bulldogs came from a penalty kick from their flyhalf, Oliver Zono, who had a good game for the Bulldogs. During the first half, there were some sniping individual runs from the Pumas' backs, but these were quelled by the Bulldogs. But just six minutes before halftime the Pumas were awarded three penalties in a three-minute session of play, and taking a scrum for the third, their left wing Marcello Sampson broke through to score under the posts. The try was easily converted by Pumas flyhalf Justin van Staden, who earlier had missed a long-range penalty against the wind. The halftime score was 7-3 for the Pumas. In the second minute of the second stanza, Van Staden succeeded with a penalty from about 30 metres out and thereafter Border were never in the game as they struggled to hold back the rampant visitors. Lock for the Bulldogs, Lindokuhle Welemu played well, however, and was strong on defence and attack but was just not able to breach the Pumas' defence on occasions. A further two penalties by Van Staden and a magnificent flying try down the right wing by reserve back Tyler Fisher halfway through the stanza, followed by a late try by the other reserve utility back, Hennie Skorbinski, who stormed over for a well-deserved try with two or three Border defenders holding on in vain after a melee to the right side of the Border posts, sewed the match up for the visitors. And so it's back to the drawing board for Border, who this season boasted the scalps of the Lions, the Sharks XV and Eastern Province under their belts. Scorers: Border 3: Penalty by flyhalf Oliver Zono. Pumas: 28: Tries to left wing Marcello Sampson and reserve utility backs Tyler Fisher and Hennie Skorbinski; Penalties: flyhalf Justin van Staden (3); Conversions: Van Staden (2). - African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}

The judgment made it clear that government would find itself on the wrong side of the law whenever it neglected property rights in the process of land reform, said Democratic Alliance land affairs spokesman Kraai van Niekerk. It further showed that it was only by maintaining the rule of law and upholding the willing-buyer, willing-seller principle that the government would secure political and economic stability and retain the international community's confidence. Invasions occurred because of a lack of houses and open land for  homeless South Africans, said Van Niekerk. Placing the blame for the Benoni land invasion on government foot-dragging on reform, he said the Constitutional Court ruling should make the government aware that its delivery in these areas had been \"seriously inadequate\" and that it should urgently speed up the construction of low-cost housing and the purchase and redistribution of land. The government could no longer evade its legal duty to protect the property of others as it had sought to do in the Benoni matter,  said African Christian Democratic Party justice spokesman Steve Swart.  He said the judgment had affirmed the concept of compassionate justice, constitutional compensation and the rule of law.  \"It is now clear that our courts will not tolerate land invasions and that the state has a responsibility to act in order to protect the property rights of land owners and to promote the right of access to land and housing by the landless,\" said Agri SA president Lourie Bosman. Describing the ruling on the \"sensitive\" issue as balanced and well thought-out, he said it had renewed the organisation's confidence in the judicial system. AgriSA remained committed to land reform and to supporting and co-operating with the government to ensure \"a fair deal for everybody regarding the use of land\", he said. Sapa","label":0}

The bank's announcement came a fortnight after it had intervened unsuccessfully in the currency markets in a bid to claw back the New Zealand dollar from an historic 0.78-dollar high. The central bank said it had changed its management of foreign currency. The bank would hold some of its foreign reserves on an unhedged basis, and build them up by selling and buying in New Zealand dollars rather than overseas currencies. Westpac currency strategist Michael Gordon told the New Zealand Herald newspaper that the move was similar to the Australian approach of a gradual, less visible selling of the dollar, which the New Zealand  Reserve Bank admired. Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard said that although the new, \"more  passive\" approach would not necessarily affect the exchange rate it might send a discouraging signal to speculators. \"It would allow the bank to give concrete signals regarding the extent to which the exchange rate is seen as over- or under-valued. That may indirectly affect the exchange rate by discouraging speculators from pushing the currency to extreme levels,\" Bollard said. Sapa-dpa","label":0}

Habib welcomed the report for its rigour and constructive recommendations.  He said parents whose children had been harassed were \"truly angry\". \"If it had been my kids I would also be outraged.\" The university accepted the report's critiques. \"The report critically highlights the inadequacy of the university's systems to address rumours and allegations decisively, or to support those affected by predatory sexual behaviour.\"  He said a task team would be put together which would include members of the  vice-chancellor's office, experts in various fields, including gender and psychology, as well as student representatives. In April, the university appointed a legal firm to investigate sexual harassment claims following an article in the Sunday Times newspaper which claimed that a lecturer in the university's drama department had harassed a number of his students. \"It had been an exhaustive investigation,\" Habib said. Four staff members were investigated. In July, the university fired two staff members for sexual harassment after disciplinary hearings, which were chaired by Habib. \"The third case will be determined soon and the fourth is yet to begin,\" Habib said. The director of the Centre for Applied Legal Studies (CALS) at the university, Professor Bonita Meyersfeld, said drafting the report was a challenge. \"The report has been one of the most difficult for the whole team because you are dealing with one's own university,\" Meyersfeld said. Students and staff members were initially reluctant to come forward when the  inquiry began in February. But in the final two months of the inquiry, more people started coming forward. The team in charge of drafting the report comprised three lawyers from Norton Rose Fulbright SA and two members, including Meyersfeld, from CALS. The inquiry was completed on August 15. One of the report's findings was that the university had a \"vague\" policy on  sexual harassment which made it difficult for people to come forward. The report recommended that the university create a very clear and broad definition of sexual harassment in order to explain the range of activity that constitutes it. \"A number of our staff and students feel the university has not done enough,  we need to prove ourselves to them,\" said Habib. \"What we will do is acknowledge and craft a plan to comprehensively address the challenge.

We are not responsive to the needs of our citizens.\" Ngcaba was speaking at the Green Cities conference at Gallagher Estate in Midrand. Ngcaba cited statistics that 90 percent of pupils in rural areas walked to school. More than half of people in rural areas also walked to work. She said government would seek to invest in non-motorised transport that would provide quality, safe travel to both cyclists and walkers. Citing the same statistics, Ngcaba said only about 8.7 percent of people in urban areas walked to work. Walking and bicycling were more common in cities in countries other than South Africa. She said city planning in South Africa had resulted in \"spatial distortion\" that left most of the nation's citizens living outside urban areas from both services and places of work. As a result, people had to travel long distances and use \"unreliable, unsafe  and fragmented public transport\". \"This has created a situation of an unsustainable reliance on motor vehicles  and the tendencies for many of our citizens to purchase cars as soon as they are able to afford them,\" Ngcaba said. She said this situation had led to unprecedented traffic congestion in SA cities. Ngcaba said the DEA and Department of Transport would be making new efforts to build infrastructure for non-motorised transport, including the construction  of sidewalks and bike paths. This would be done with funding from the German KfW Development Bank. DEA director of policy co-ordination Jenitha Budal said three cities --Durban, Johannesburg and Polokwane -- were already introducing plans to make urban areas more friendly for pedestrians and cyclists, with the help of R50 million from KfW as well as their own funding. She said Durban was the most advanced and was building sidewalks and bike paths alongside roads. The City was also launching a program to encourage municipal officials to cycle between offices in the municipality, instead of driving. Johannesburg's efforts are focused on Soweto and building sidewalks and bike  paths on feeder roads around the Bus Rapid Transit System. Sapa \/ts\/hdw\/ma\/dd","label":0}

On the stock market, shares got an early boost after there were no major anti-Japanese protests in China. Violent demonstrations, as well as boycotts of Japanese goods, had erupted in Beijing and other Chinese cities earlier this month, especially on weekends, leading to concern that Japanese companies with operations there would suffer lower profits. Many Japanese manufacturers are heavily reliant on their Chinese  factories, while many companies view China as a key consumer market.

Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. were among the early gainers. In New York on Friday, stocks fell as investors dealt with disappointing earnings in the consumer sector and rising oil prices. Investors worried that disappointing news from consumer retailers and manufacturers, including Maytag Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp., spelled a cutback in consumer spending that could derail a steady flow of profits for corporate America.

He said the dumping of old nets by fishing boats from several countries nets was a \"cause of great concern that required urgent remedial attention.\" He appealed for fishermen to bring old nets ashore and dispose of them in an environmentally safe manner. So-called ghost fishing happens when the discarded nets continue  to \"fish\" as they float in the ocean, ensnaring marine life. Gallagher said a recent report by eight fisheries agencies entitled \"A preliminary investigation on Shelf Edge and Deepwater Fixed Net Fisheries to the West and North of Great Britain, Ireland, around Rockall and Hatton Bank\" had concluded that \"as many as one and a half million sharks have been killed by these nets in the last decade,\" Gallagher told AFP. \"Fish become entangled in the discarded nets and then you have this big mortality rate.  \"The problem is mainly off our north-west coast, off Scotland and off Norway. \"We should be trying to retrieve these nets but there is no point in that if the practise of dumping them continues.\" Gallagher said gill nets with a big mesh size were mainly used to catch monkfish and cod. There were up to ten kilometres long. \"Gill netting is a very friendly type of fishing because it allows a lot of escapement of the small fish but nobody can condone  obsolete nets being thrown overboard.  \"That is not acceptable at all. The sad thing about it is the mortality rate as a result.\" Gallagher said it was impossible to estimate how many kilometres  of nets had been dumped over the years. \"They end up floating down onto the seabed or getting entangled in wrecks. \"We are calling on fishermen to terminate this practice and when  their nets are obsolete to take them back in.\" He said a lot of the dumping was happening in deepwater fisheries straddling international waters, so a comprehensive international approach to the problem was needed. Gallagher said it was important that the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) should be fully involved and would hopefully act as a catalyst for measures to remedy the problem. \"A retrieval system to remove some of this lost gear may be developed as a pilot project by the EU and Norway.

The report, titled \"Six Years and Counting\", is a result of an investigation  of the department's administration of the Suikerbosrand Project. The project, which commenced in 2008, involved the upgrading of the water supply to the nature reserve in the area at a cost of R8,657,745. \"The department failed in its duty of overseeing the smooth running of the project, thus causing delay in the completion of the project,\" said Thuli Madonsela. \"During the project, there was mismanagement of state funds and disregard for procurement policies, treasury regulations and the Public Finance Management Act.\" A complaint was laid against the department by Nathaniel Letlape, a small business contractor based in Leondale. Letlape alleged that the main contractor, Moteko Construction Cost Consultants JV, which was contracted to upgrade the water supply to the Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, was improperly appointed in contravention of a fair, transparent and cost-effective procurement process. Moteko was appointed by way of an Instruction to Perform Work (IPW) in terms  of treasury regulations, Madonsela said. \"The department's failure to open the Suikerbosrand project to a fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective procurement process and opting for an IPW with a view to fast track service delivery was not viable and  cannot be justified.\" Contrary to what was anticipated by the IPW, the project has been plagued by  delays. \"The project remains incomplete six years since it was commenced on 17 November 2008 and was supposed to be completed on 20 May 2009.\" Madonsela found that the department mismanaged the project, and owed Letlape  for services rendered on the project.

Their release followed the freeing of five other abducted oil workers on Monday in the oil city of Port Harcourt, capital of nearby Rivers State, officials said. But other oil workers are still being held captive. Also on Monday in Port Harcourt four workers -- a Briton, an Irishman, a German and an American -- were abducted from a popular bar in the centre of the city, the police said. Including another German worker seized in Port Harcourt on August 3 brings to five the number of foreign oil workers still in the custody of their abductors. The previously unknown Movement for the Niger Delta People (MONDP) had claimed responsibility for kidnapping the German man, and demanded the release of two local leaders standing trial for corruption in exchange for his freedom. MONDP said he was being held to demand the release of two Niger Delta leaders, former Bayelsa State governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha and regional warlord Mujahid Dokubo-Asari.  No claims of responsibility have been made for the abduction of the other four foreigners. Port Harcourt is at the heart of Nigeria's multi-billion-dollar oil and gas industry where many oil firms have their operational bases. Since the beginning of the year, separatist militants have stepped up their campaign for greater benefits from the oil proceeds and to protest against environmental devastation. Around 40 expatriate oil workers have been abducted and released  after spending days or weeks in captivity. Nigeria, a nation of 130 million people, is the world's sixth biggest crude exporter with a daily output of 2.6 million barrels, a quarter of which is lost to unrest. As Africa's largest oil producer, Nigeria derives more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange earnings from oil. Sapa-AFP","label":1}

After taking a 13th-minute lead through Tokelo Rantie, the visitors found themselves 2-1 down midway through and never recovered from that setback. The two sides meet again in Durban on Tuesday in which Bafana have to win to remain in contention. South Africa earned the first corner kick with their very first attack as they begun the match impressively. The hosts then created two gilt edged quick chances but nothing much came out of them. Tokelo Rantie then put Bafana Bafana ahead with his trademark solo and lethal finishing in the 13th minute. He received a long ball from the back, shrugged off two defenders before slotting the ball home. The visitors then settled down as Zungu and Dolly temporarily took charge of the midfield. Zwane then released Rantie on the 31st minute but the Cape Verde keeper came off his line on time. The hosts capitalised quickly and scored from a counter attack to make it 1-1. They then immediately got a penalty to make it 2-1 as Bafana Bafana seemed shell-shocked. In the second half and playing with the wind, South Africa threw everything into the game. Kamohelo Mokotjo came in for struggling Zungu as Bafana Bafana continued to chase the game. Eric Mathoho then got a red card for an off the ball tackle which in most instances could have been a yellow card as the visitors were left with a mountain to climb. As South Africa threw everything upfront, there were chances of leaving gaps at the back and twice they were caught on the back foot. Percy Tau came on for Rantie as Bafana Bafana tried to salvage something from the game. It was never to be and Bafana must regroup quickly as they meet the same side on Tuesday at Moses Mabhida Stadium. \u2013 African News Agency (ANA)","label":0}
